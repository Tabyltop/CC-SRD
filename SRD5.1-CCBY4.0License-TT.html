<h1 id='Races'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Races  </b></span></h1>
<h3 id='RacialTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Racial Traits   </b></span></h3>
<p>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.  </p>
<h4 id='AbilityScoreIncrease'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Increase  </b></span></h4>
<p>Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.  </p>
<h4 id='Age'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Age  </b></span></h4>
<p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.  </p>
<h4 id='Alignment'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Alignment  </b></span></h4>
<p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.  </p>
<h4 id='Size'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Size  </b></span></h4>
<p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”  </p>
<h4 id='Speed'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Speed   </b></span></h4>
<p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling ( “Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).  </p>
<h4 id='Languages'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Languages  </b></span></h4>
<p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.  </p>
<h4 id='Subraces'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Subraces </b></span></h4>
<p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.  </p>
<h2 id='Dwarf'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dwarf </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='DwarfTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dwarf Traits </b></span></h3>
<p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature. </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b>Your Constitution score increases by 2. </p>
<p><b><em>Age.  </em></b>Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years. </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment.  </em></b>Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order. </p>
<p><b><em>Size. </em></b>Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. </p>
<p><b><em>Speed. </em></b>Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor. </p>
<p><b><em>Darkvision. </em></b>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
<p><b><em>Dwarven Resilience.  </em></b>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. </p>
<p><b><em>Dwarven Combat Training. </em></b>You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer. </p>
<p><b><em>Tool Proficiency. </em></b>You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools. </p>
<p><b><em>Stonecunning.  </em></b>Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. </p>
<p><b><em>Languages. </em></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak. </p>
<h4 id='HillDwarf'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hill Dwarf  </b></span></h4>
<p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase.  </em></b>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.  </p>
<p><b><em>Dwarven Toughness. </em></b> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.  </p>
<h2 id='Elf'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Elf  </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='ElfTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Elf Traits  </b></span></h3>
<p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase.  </em></b>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.  </p>
<p><b><em>Age. </em></b> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.  </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment. </em></b> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.  </p>
<p><b><em>Size. </em></b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.  </p>
<p><b><em>Speed. </em></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  </p>
<p><b><em>Darkvision. </em></b> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  </p>
<p><b><em>Keen Senses.  </em></b>You have proficiency in the Perception skill.  </p>
<p><b><em>Fey Ancestry. </em></b> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.  </p>
<p><b><em>Trance. </em></b> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.  </p>
<p><b><em>Languages. </em></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to </p>
<p>their repertoires. </p>
<h4 id='HighElf'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>High Elf </b></span></h4>
<p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b>Your Intelligence score increases by 1. </p>
<p><b><em>Elf Weapon Training.  </em></b>You have proficiency with the longsword, </p>
<p>shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. </p>
<p><b><em>Cantrip. </em></b>You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. </p>
<p><b><em>Extra Language.  </em></b>You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice. </p>
<h2 id='Halfling'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Halfling </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='HalflingTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Halfling Traits </b></span></h3>
<p>Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings. </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b>Your Dexterity score increases by 2. </p>
<p><b><em>Age.  </em></b>A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century. </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment. </em></b>Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their </p>
<p>community and the comfort of their old ways. </p>
<p><b><em>Size. </em></b>Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. </p>
<p><b><em>Speed. </em></b>Your base walking speed is 25 feet. </p>
<p><b><em>Lucky. </em></b>When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. </p>
<p><b><em>Brave. </em></b>You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. </p>
<p><b><em>Halfling Nimbleness.  </em></b>You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.  </p>
<p><b><em>Languages. </em></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.  </p>
<h4 id='Lightfoot'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Lightfoot  </b></span></h4>
<p>As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.  Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b> Your Charisma score increases by 1.  </p>
<p><b><em>Naturally Stealthy. </em></b> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.  </p>
<h2 id='Human'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Human  </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='HumanTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Human Traits   </b></span></h3>
<p>It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase.  </em></b>Your ability scores each increase by 1.  </p>
<p><b><em>Age. </em></b> Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.  </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment. </em></b> Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.  </p>
<p><b><em>Size. </em></b> Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.  </p>
<p><b><em>Speed. </em></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  </p>
<p><b><em>Languages. </em></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.  </p>
<h2 id='Dragonborn'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dragonborn </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='DragonbornTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dragonborn Traits </b></span></h3>
<p>Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn. </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b>Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by </p>
<p>1. </p>
<p><b><em>Age.  </em></b>Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80. </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment. </em></b>Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible villains. </p>
<p><b><em>Size. </em></b>Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium. </p>
<p><b><em>Speed. </em></b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet. </p>
<h4 id='DraconicAncestry'><b>Draconic Ancestry </b>  </h4>

<p><b><em>Draconic Ancestry. </em></b>You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table. </p>
<p><b><em>Breath Weapon. </em></b>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. </p>
<p>When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful  </p>
<p>one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.  After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.  </p>
<p><b><em>Damage Resistance.  </em></b>You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.  </p>
<p><b><em>Languages. </em></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.  </p>
<h2 id='Gnome'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Gnome  </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='GnomeTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Gnome Traits   </b></span></h3>
<p>Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all other gnomes.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.  </p>
<p><b><em>Age. </em></b> Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.  </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment. </em></b> Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.   </p>
<p><b><em>Size. </em></b> Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.  </p>
<p><b><em>Speed. </em></b> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.  </p>
<p><b><em>Darkvision. </em></b> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  </p>
<p><b><em>Gnome Cunning. </em></b> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.  </p>
<p><b><em>Languages. </em></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.  </p>
<h4 id='RockGnome'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rock Gnome  </b></span></h4>
<p>As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b>Your Constitution score increases by 1. </p>
<p><b><em>Artificer’s Lore. </em></b>Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply. </p>
<p><b><em>Tinker. </em></b>You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. </p>
<p>When you create a device, choose one of the following options: </p>
<p><em>Clockwork Toy.  </em>This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents. </p>
<p><em>Fire Starter.  </em>The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action. </p>
<p><em>Music Box.  </em>When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed. </p>
<h2 id='HalfElf'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Half-Elf </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='HalfElfTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Half-Elf Traits </b></span></h3>
<p>Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves. </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></b>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1. </p>
<p><b><em>Age.  </em></b>Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years. </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment.  </em></b>Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and  </p>
<p>sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.  </p>
<p><b><em>Size.  </em></b>Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.  </p>
<p><b><em>Speed. </em></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  </p>
<p><b><em>Darkvision. </em></b> Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  </p>
<p><b><em>Fey Ancestry.  </em></b>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.  </p>
<p><b><em>Skill Versatility.  </em></b>You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.  </p>
<p><b><em>Languages.  </em></b>You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.  </p>
<h2 id='HalfOrc'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Half-Orc  </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='HalfOrcTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Half-Orc Traits   </b></span></h3>
<p>Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase.  </em></b>Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.  </p>
<p><b><em>Age.  </em></b>Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.  </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment.  </em></b>Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.  </p>
<p><b><em>Size.  </em></b>Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.  </p>
<p><b><em>Speed.  </em></b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  </p>
<p><b><em>Darkvision.  </em></b>Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  </p>
<p><b><em>Menacing.  </em></b>You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.  </p>
<p><b><em>Relentless Endurance.  </em></b>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. </p>
<p><b><em>Savage Attacks.  </em></b>When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit. </p>
<p><b><em>Languages.  </em></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script. </p>
<h2 id='Tiefling'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Tiefling </b></span></h2>
<h3 id='TieflingTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Tiefling Traits </b></span></h3>
<p>Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal </p>
<p>descent. </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Score Increase.  </em></b>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. </p>
<p><b><em>Age. </em></b>Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. </p>
<p><b><em>Alignment. </em></b>Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward </p>
<p>evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment. </p>
<p><b><em>Size.  </em></b>Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. </p>
<p><b><em>Speed.  </em></b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet. </p>
<p><b><em>Darkvision.  </em></b>Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only </p>
<p>shades of gray. </p>
<p><b><em>Hellish Resistance.  </em></b>You have resistance to fire damage. </p>
<p><b><em>Infernal Legacy.  </em></b>You know the  <em>thaumaturgy </em></p>
<p>cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the  </p>
<p><em>hellish rebuke  </em>spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the  </p>
<p><em>darkness </em>spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. </p>
<p><b><em>Languages.  </em></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal. </p>
<h1 id='Barbarian'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Barbarian   </b></span></h1>

<h3 id='Rage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rage </b></span></h3>
<p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. </p>
<p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor: </p>
<p>•You have advantage on Strength checks andStrength saving throws. </p>
<p>•When you make a melee weapon attack usingStrength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of theBarbarian table. </p>
<p>•You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. </p>
<p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your </p>
<p>turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. </p>
<p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. </p>
<h3 id='UnarmoredDefense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Unarmored Defense </b></span></h3>
<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this </p>
<p>benefit. </p>
<h3 id='RecklessAttack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Reckless Attack  </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.  </p>
<h3 id='DangerSense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Danger Sense   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.  You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.  </p>
<h3 id='PrimalPath'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Primal Path   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='ExtraAttack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Extra Attack   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.  </p>
<h3 id='FastMovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Fast Movement   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.  </p>
<h3 id='FeralInstinct'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Feral Instinct   </b></span></h3>
<p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.  Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.  </p>
<h3 id='BrutalCritical'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Brutal Critical </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. </p>
<p>This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. </p>
<h3 id='RelentlessRage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Relentless Rage </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. </p>
<p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. </p>
<h3 id='PersistentRage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Persistent Rage </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. </p>
<h3 id='IndomitableMight'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Indomitable Might </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. </p>
<h3 id='PrimalChampion'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Primal Champion </b></span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, you embody the power ofthe wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. </p>
<h3 id='PathoftheBerserker'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Path of the Berserker </b></span></h3>
<p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end-that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, </p>
<p>slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. </p>
<h4 id='Frenzy'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Frenzy </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix PH-A). </p>
<h4 id='MindlessRage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mindless Rage  </b></span></h4>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.  </p>
<h4 id='IntimidatingPresence'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Intimidating Presence  </b></span></h4>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.  If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.  </p>
<h4 id='Retaliation'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Retaliation  </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.  </p>

<h3 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting </b></span></h3>
<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with </p>
<p>your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. </p>
<h4 id='Cantrips'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cantrips  </b></span></h4>
<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellSlots'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Slots  </b></span></h4>
<p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  For example, if you know the 1st-level spell  <em>cure wounds </em> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast  <em>cure wounds </em> using either slot.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellsKnownof1stLevelandHigher'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher  </b></span></h4>
<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.  The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.  Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability  </b></span></h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  </p>
<p><b>Spell save DC </b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  </p>
<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  </p>
<h4 id='RitualCasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ritual Casting   </b></span></h4>
<p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingFocus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Focus </b></span></h4>
<p>You can use a musical instrument (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. </p>
<h3 id='BardicInspiration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bardic Inspiration </b></span></h3>
<p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. </p>
<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after </p>
<p>it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. </p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. </p>
<p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a </p>
<p>d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. </p>
<h3 id='JackofAllTrades'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Jack of All Trades </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus. </p>
<h3 id='SongofRest'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Song of Rest </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more </p>
<p>Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. </p>
<p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. </p>
<h3 id='BardCollege'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bard College </b></span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you delve intothe advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice, such as the College of Lore. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. </p>
<h3 id='Expertise'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Expertise  </b></span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.  At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='FontofInspiration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Font of Inspiration   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.  </p>
<h3 id='Countercharm'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Countercharm   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).  </p>
<h3 id='MagicalSecrets'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Magical Secrets   </b></span></h3>
<p>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.  The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.  You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.  </p>
<h3 id='SuperiorInspiration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Superior Inspiration   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.  </p>
<h3 id='CollegeofLore'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>College of Lore </b></span></h3>
<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. </p>
<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. </p>
<p>The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority. </p>
<h4 id='BonusProficiencies'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bonus Proficiencies </b></span></h4>
<p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice. </p>
<h4 id='CuttingWords'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cutting Words </b></span></h4>
<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or </p>
<p>if it’s immune to being charmed. </p>
<h4 id='AdditionalMagicalSecrets'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Additional Magical Secrets </b></span></h4>
<p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know. </p>
<h4 id='PeerlessSkill'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Peerless Skill  </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.  </p>

<h3 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting </b></span></h3>
<p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. </p>
<h4 id='Cantrips'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cantrips </b></span></h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. </p>
<h4 id='PreparingandCastingSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Preparing and Casting Spells  </b></span></h4>
<p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell  <em>cure wounds </em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.  You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability  </b></span></h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  </p>
<p><b>SpellsaveDC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  </p>
<p><b>Spellattackmodifier </b>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  </p>
<h4 id='RitualCasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ritual Casting   </b></span></h4>
<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingFocus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Focus  </b></span></h4>
<p>You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.  </p>
<h3 id='DivineDomain'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Divine Domain   </b></span></h3>
<p>Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. </p>
<h4 id='DomainSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Domain Spells </b></span></h4>
<p>Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. </p>
<p>If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. </p>
<h3 id='ChannelDivinity'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Channel Divinity </b></span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. </p>
<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. </p>
<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. </p>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. </p>
<h4 id='ChannelDivinityTurnUndead'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead </b></span></h4>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. </p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='DestroyUndead'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Destroy Undead   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.  </p>
<h4 id='DestroyUndead'><b>Destroy Undead   </b></h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Cleric Level </b></th><th ><b>Destroys Undead of CR . . . </b></th></tr><tr><td >5th </td><td >1/2 or lower </td></tr><tr><td >8th </td><td >1 or lower </td></tr><tr><td >11th </td><td >2  or lower </td></tr><tr><td >14th </td><td >3 or lower </td></tr><tr><td >17th </td><td >4 or lower </td></tr></table>
<h3 id='DivineIntervention'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Divine Intervention   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.  Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.  If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.  At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.  </p>
<h3 id='LifeDomain'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Life Domain  </b></span></h3>
<p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy-one of the fundamental forces of the universe-that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei). </p>

<h4 id='BonusProficiency'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bonus Proficiency </b></span></h4>
<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. </p>
<h4 id='DiscipleofLife'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Disciple of Life </b></span></h4>
<p>Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. </p>
<h4 id='ChannelDivinityPreserveLife'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. </p>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct. </p>
<h4 id='BlessedHealer'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Blessed Healer </b></span></h4>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. </p>
<h4 id='DivineStrike'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Divine Strike </b></span></h4>
<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. </p>
<h4 id='SupremeHealing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Supreme Healing </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for  </p>
<p>each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.  </p>
<h1 id='Druid'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Druid  </b></span></h1>
<h2 id='ClassFeatures'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Class Features  </b></span></h2>
<p>As a druid, you gain the following class features.  </p>
<h4 id='HitPoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hit Points  </b></span></h4>
<p><b>Hit Dice:  </b>1d8 per druid level  </p>
<p><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:  </b>8 + your Constitution modifier  </p>
<p><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:  </b>1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st  </p>
<h4 id='Proficiencies'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Proficiencies  </b></span></h4>
<p><b>Armor:  </b>Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)  </p>
<p><b>Weapons:  </b>Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears </p>
<p><b>Tools:  </b>Herbalism kit </p>
<p><b>Saving Throws:  </b>Intelligence, Wisdom </p>
<p><b>Skills:  </b>Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival </p>
<h4 id='Equipment'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Equipment </b></span></h4>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: </p>
<p>•( <em>a </em>) a wooden shield or ( <em>b </em>) any simple weapon </p>
<p>•( <em>a </em>) a scimitar or ( <em>b </em>) any simple melee weapon </p>

<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. </p>
<h3 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting </b></span></h3>
<p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. </p>
<h4 id='Cantrips'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cantrips  </b></span></h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.  </p>
<h4 id='PreparingandCastingSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Preparing and Casting Spells  </b></span></h4>
<p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell  <em>cure wounds,  </em>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.  You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability  </b></span></h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  </p>
<p><b>SpellsaveDC </b>=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  </p>
<p><b>Spellattackmodifier </b>=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  </p>
<h4 id='RitualCasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ritual Casting   </b></span></h4>
<p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingFocus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Focus </b></span></h4>
<p>You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. </p>
<h3 id='WildShape'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Wild Shape </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. </p>
<p>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. </p>
<h4 id='BeastShapes'><b>Beast Shapes </b>  </h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Level </b></th><th ><b>Max.  CR </b></th><th ><b>Limitations </b></th><th ><b>Example </b></th></tr><tr><td >2nd </td><td >1/4 </td><td >No flying or swimming  speed </td><td >Wolf </td></tr><tr><td >4th </td><td >1/2 </td><td >No flying speed </td><td >Crocodile </td></tr><tr><td >8th </td><td >1 </td><td >- </td><td >Giant  eagle </td></tr></table>
<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your </p>
<p>turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. </p>
<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply: </p>
<p>•Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, andCharisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, </p>
<p>use the creature’sbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. </p>
<p>•When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However,if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points,any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you </p>
<p>revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.  </p>
<p>•You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transformingdoesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’vealready cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as  </p>
<p><em>call lightning </em>, that you’ve already cast. </p>
<p>•You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.However, you can’t use any of your special senses,such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. </p>
<p>•You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form,or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment,based on the creature’s shape and size. Yourequipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. </p>
<h3 id='DruidCircle'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Druid Circle   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='TimelessBody'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Timeless Body   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.  </p>
<h3 id='BeastSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Beast Spells   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components. </p>
<h3 id='Archdruid'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Archdruid </b></span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. </p>
<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. </p>
<h3 id='CircleoftheLand'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Circle of the Land </b></span></h3>
<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold </p>
<p>to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites. </p>
<h4 id='BonusCantrip'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bonus Cantrip </b></span></h4>
<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. </p>
<h4 id='NaturalRecovery'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Natural Recovery </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. </p>
<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. </p>
<h4 id='CircleSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Circle Spells </b></span></h4>
<p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. </p>
<p> Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.  </p>

<h4 id='LandsStride'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Land’s Stride </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. </p>
<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the  </p>
<p><em>entangle </em>spell. </p>
<h4 id='NaturesWard'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Nature’s Ward </b></span></h4>
<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. </p>
<h4 id='NaturesSanctuary'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Nature’s Sanctuary </b></span></h4>
<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC.On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses.On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. </p>
<h4 id='SacredPlantsandWood'><b>Sacred Plants and Wood </b></h4>
<p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. </p>
<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. </p>
<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. </p>
<h4 id='DruidsandtheGods'><b>Druids and the Gods   </b></h4>
<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH--B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.  </p>

<h3 id='UnarmoredDefense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Unarmored Defense </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. </p>
<h3 id='MartialArts'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Martial Arts </b></span></h3>
<p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. </p>
<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: </p>
<p>•You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike sand monk weapons. </p>
<p>•You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage ofyour unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. </p>
<p>•When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can </p>
<p>make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.  Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.  </p>
<h3 id='Ki'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ki  </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.  You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.  When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.  Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:  </p>
<p><b>KisaveDC </b>=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  </p>
<h4 id='FlurryofBlows'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Flurry of Blows  </b></span></h4>

<h3 id='MonasticTradition'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Monastic Tradition </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as </p>
<p>the Way of the Open Hand. </p>

<h3 id='DeflectMissiles'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Deflect Missiles </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. </p>
<p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a </p>
<p>ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by </p>
<p>1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. </p>

<h3 id='KiEmpoweredStrikes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.  </p>
<h3 id='Evasion'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Evasion  </b></span></h3>
<p>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a  <em>fireball </em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.  </p>
<h3 id='StillnessofMind'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Stillness of Mind   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.  </p>
<h3 id='PurityofBody'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Purity of Body   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.  </p>
<h3 id='TongueoftheSunandMoon'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon  </b></span></h3>

<h3 id='DiamondSoul'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Diamond Soul   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.  Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.  </p>
<h3 id='TimelessBody'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Timeless Body   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.  </p>
<h3 id='EmptyBody'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Empty Body </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. </p>
<p>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the  </p>
<p><em>astral projection </em>spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you. </p>
<h3 id='PerfectSelf'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Perfect Self </b></span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points. </p>
<h2 id='MonasticTraditions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Monastic Traditions </b></span></h2>
<p>Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor </p>
<p>the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level. </p>
<h3 id='WayoftheOpenHand'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Way of the Open Hand </b></span></h3>
<p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm. </p>
<h4 id='OpenHandTechnique'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Open Hand Technique </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: </p>
<p>•It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. </p>
<p>•It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails,you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. </p>
<p>•It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn. </p>

At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a  <em>sanctuary </em> spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.  </p>
<h4 id='QuiveringPalm'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Quivering Palm  </b></span></h4>
<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.  You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.  </p>

<h3 id='DivineSense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Divine Sense </b></span></h3>
<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the  </p>
<p><em>hallow </em>spell. </p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. </p>

<p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.  As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.  Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.  This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.  </p>
<h3 id='FightingStyle'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Fighting Style  </b></span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.  </p>
<h4 id='Defense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Defense  </b></span></h4>
<p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.  </p>
<h4 id='Dueling'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dueling  </b></span></h4>
<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.  </p>
<h4 id='GreatWeaponFighting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Great Weapon Fighting   </b></span></h4>
<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.  </p>
<h4 id='Protection'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Protection  </b></span></h4>
<p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.  </p>
<h3 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting   </b></span></h3>
<p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.  </p>
<h4 id='PreparingandCastingSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Preparing and Casting Spells </b></span></h4>
<p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </p>
<p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one </p>
<p>spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </p>
<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell  </p>
<p><em>cure wounds, </em></p>
<p>you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. </p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells whenyou finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability </b></span></h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, </p>
<p>since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when </p>
<p>making an attack roll with one. </p>
<p><b>SpellsaveDC </b>=8 + your proficiency bonus +your Charisma modifier </p>
<p><b>Spellattackmodifier </b>=your proficiency bonus +your Charisma modifier </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingFocus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Focus </b></span></h4>
<p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. </p>
<h3 id='DivineSmite'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Divine Smite </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, </p>
<p>plus 1d8 for each spell level  </p>
<p>higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.  </p>
<h3 id='DivineHealth'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Divine Health   </b></span></h3>
<p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.  </p>
<h3 id='SacredOath'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sacred Oath   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.  Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.  </p>
<h4 id='OathSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Oath Spells  </b></span></h4>
<p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.  If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.  </p>
<h4 id='ChannelDivinity'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Channel Divinity  </b></span></h4>
<p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.  When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.  Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='ExtraAttack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Extra A ttack   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.  </p>
<h3 id='AuraofProtection'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Aura of Protection </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. </p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. </p>
<h3 id='AuraofCourage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Aura of Courage </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. </p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. </p>
<h3 id='ImprovedDivineSmite'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Improved Divine Smite </b></span></h3>
<p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. </p>
<h3 id='CleansingTouch'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cleansing Touch </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. </p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. </p>
<h2 id='SacredOaths'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sacred Oaths </b></span></h2>
<p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart. </p>
<h3 id='OathofDevotion'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Oath of Devotion </b></span></h3>
<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these  </p>
<p>paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.  </p>
<h4 id='TenetsofDevotion'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Tenets of Devotion  </b></span></h4>
<p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.  </p>
<p><b><em>Honesty. </em></b>Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.  </p>
<p><b><em>Courage. </em></b>Never fear to act, though caution is wise.  </p>
<p><b><em>Compassion. </em></b>Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.  </p>
<p><b><em>Honor. </em></b>Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.  </p>
<p><b><em>Duty. </em></b>Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.  </p>
<h4 id='OathSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Oath Spells  </b></span></h4>
<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.  </p>
<h4 id='OathofDevotionSpells'><b>Oath of Devotion Spells   </b></h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Paladin  Level </b></th><th ><b>Spells </b></th></tr><tr><td >3rd </td><td ><em>protection from evil and good, sanct ua ry </em></td></tr><tr><td >5th </td><td ><em>lesser restoration, zone of truth </em></td></tr><tr><td >9th </td><td ><em>beacon of hope, dispel magic </em></td></tr><tr><td >13th </td><td ><em>freedom of movement, guardian of faith </em></td></tr><tr><td >17th </td><td ><em>commune, flame strike </em></td></tr></table>
<h4 id='ChannelDivinity'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Channel Divinity  </b></span></h4>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.  </p>
<p><b><em> Sacred Weapon.  </em></b>As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.  </p>
<p>You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or </p>
<p>carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Turn the Unholy. </em></b>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. </p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. </p>
<h4 id='AuraofDevotion'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Aura of Devotion </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. </p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. </p>
<h4 id='PurityofSpirit'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Purity of Spirit </b></span></h4>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a  </p>
<p><em>protection from evil and good </em>spell. </p>
<h4 id='HolyNimbus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Holy Nimbus </b></span></h4>
<p>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. </p>
<p>Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. </p>
<p>In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. </p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. </p>
<h4 id='BreakingYourOath'><b>Breaking Your Oath </b></h4>
<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. </p>
<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all--night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast  </p>
<p>or similar act of self--denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.  </p>
<h1 id='Ranger'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ranger   </b></span></h1>
<h2 id='ClassFeatures'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Class Features  </b></span></h2>

<h3 id='FavoredEnemy'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Favored Enemy </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. </p>
<p>Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. </p>
<p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. </p>
<p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. </p>
<p>You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As  </p>
<p>you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.  </p>
<h3 id='NaturalExplorer'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Natural Explorer   </b></span></h3>
<p>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.  While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:  </p>
<p>•Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. </p>
<p>•Your group can’t become lost except by magical means. </p>
<p>•Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. </p>
<p>•If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. </p>
<p>•When you forage, you find twice as much food asyou normally would. </p>
<p>•While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.You choose additional favored terrain types at 6thand 10th level.  </p>
<h3 id='FightingStyle'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Fighting Style  </b></span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.  </p>
<h4 id='Archery'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Archery  </b></span></h4>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.  </p>
<h4 id='Defense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Defense  </b></span></h4>
<p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.  </p>
<h4 id='Dueling'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dueling  </b></span></h4>
<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.  </p>
<h4 id='TwoWeaponFighting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Two-Weapon Fighting </b></span></h4>
<p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. </p>
<h3 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting </b></span></h3>
<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. </p>
<h4 id='SpellSlots'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Slots </b></span></h4>
<p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell  <em>animal friendship </em></p>
<p>and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast  </p>
<p><em>animal friendship </em>using either slot. </p>
<h4 id='SpellsKnownof1stLevelandHigher'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher </b></span></h4>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. </p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. </p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability </b></span></h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a </p>
<p>spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </p>
<p><b>SpellsaveDC </b>=8 + your proficiency bonus +your Wisdom modifier </p>
<p><b>Spellattackmodifier </b>=your proficiency bonus +your Wisdom modifier </p>
<h3 id='RangerArchetype'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ranger Archetype   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.  </p>
<h3 id='PrimevalAwareness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Primeval Awareness   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='ExtraAttack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Extra Attack   </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.  </p>
<h3 id='LandsStride'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Land’s Stride   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

<p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. </p>

<p><b><em> Evasion.  </em></b>When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a  <em>lightning bolt </em> spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.  </p>

<h3 id='Expertise'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Expertise </b></span></h3>
<p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. </p>
<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. </p>
<h3 id='SneakAttack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sneak Attack </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. </p>
<p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. </p>
<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. </p>
<h3 id='ThievesCant'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Thieves’ Cant </b></span></h3>
<p>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. </p>
<p>It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. </p>
<p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages,  </p>
<p>such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.  </p>
<h3 id='CunningAction'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cunning Action   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.  </p>
<h3 id='RoguishArchetype'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Roguish Archetype   </b></span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='UncannyDodge'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Uncanny Dodge   </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.  </p>
<h3 id='Evasion'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Evasion  </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an  <em>ice storm </em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.  </p>
<h3 id='ReliableTalent'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Reliable Talent   </b></span></h3>
<p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.  </p>
<h3 id='Blindsense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Blindsense </b></span></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 </p>
<p>feet of you. </p>
<h3 id='SlipperyMind'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Slippery Mind </b></span></h3>
<p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. </p>
<h3 id='Elusive'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Elusive </b></span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. </p>
<h3 id='StrokeofLuck'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Stroke of Luck </b></span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. </p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. </p>
<h2 id='RoguishArchetypes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Roguish Archetypes </b></span></h2>
<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. </p>
<h3 id='Thief'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Thief </b></span></h3>
<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ. </p>
<h4 id='FastHands'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Fast Hands </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity  </p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Second-StoryWork </b></span>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.  </p>
<h4 id='SupremeSneak'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Supreme Sneak  </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.  </p>
<h4 id='UseMagicDevice'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Use Magic Device  </b></span></h4>
<p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.  </p>
<h4 id='ThiefsReflexes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Thief’s Reflexes  </b></span></h4>
<p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.  </p>
<h1 id='Sorcerer'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sorcerer  </b></span></h1>
<h2 id='ClassFeatures'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Class Features  </b></span></h2>

<h3 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting   </b></span></h3>
<p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.  </p>
<h4 id='Cantrips'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cantrips  </b></span></h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellSlots'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Slots  </b></span></h4>
<p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  For example, if you know the 1st-level spell  <em>burning hands </em> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast  <em>burning hands </em> using either slot.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellsKnownof1stLevelandHigher'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher  </b></span></h4>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.  The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability  </b></span></h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  </p>
<p><b>SpellsaveDC </b>=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  </p>
<p><b>Spellattackmodifier </b>=your proficiency bonus +your Charisma modifier </p>

<h4 id='CarefulSpell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Careful Spell  </b></span></h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.  </p>

<h4 id='QuickenedSpell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Quickened Spell  </b></span></h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.  </p>

<p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. </p>
<h4 id='TwinnedSpell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Twinned Spell </b></span></h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). </p>
<p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example,  </p>

<h2 id='SorcerousOrigins'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sorcerous Origins </b></span></h2>
<p>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic, such as a draconic bloodline. </p>
<h3 id='DraconicBloodline'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Draconic Bloodline </b></span></h3>
<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. </p>
<h4 id='DragonAncestor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dragon Ancestor </b></span></h4>
<p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. </p>

Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check  when interacting with dragons, your proficiency  bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.  <span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Draconic Resilience  </b></span>As magic flows through your body,  it causes physical  traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st  level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and  increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in  this class.     Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a  thin sheen of dragon -like scales. When you aren’t  wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity  modifier. </td></tr></table>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>ElementalAffinity </b></span>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.  </p>
<h4 id='DragonWings'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dragon Wings  </b></span></h4>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.  </p>
<h4 id='DraconicPresence'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Draconic Presence  </b></span></h4>

As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or </p>
<p>frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours. </p>

<h3 id='PactMagic'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Pact Magic </b></span></h3>
<p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. </p>
<h4 id='Cantrips'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cantrips </b></span></h4>

<p>cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellSlots'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Slots  </b></span></h4>
<p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.  For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell  <em>thunderwave </em>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellsKnownof1stLevelandHigher'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher  </b></span></h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.  The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher.

<p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. </p>

<h4 id='PactoftheChain'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Pact of the Chain </b></span></h4>
<p>You learn the  <em>find familiar </em>spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. </p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. </p>
<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. </p>
<h4 id='PactoftheBlade'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Pact of the Blade </b></span></h4>
<p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. </p>
<p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. </p>
<p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your  </p>
<p>pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.  </p>

<p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.  If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  </p>
<h3 id='MysticArcanum'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mystic Arcanum  </b></span></h3>
<p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.  You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.  At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.  </p>

The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. </p>
<p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to  </p>

<h2 id='OtherworldlyPatrons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Otherworldly Patrons </b></span></h2>
<p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. </p>
<p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals. </p>
<h3 id='TheFiend'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Fiend </b></span></h3>
<p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths. </p>
<h4 id='ExpandedSpellList'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Expanded Spell List </b></span></h4>
<p>The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. </p>
<h4 id='FiendExpandedSpells'><b>Fiend Expanded Spells </b>  </h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Spell Level </b></th><th ><b>Spells </b></th></tr><tr><td >1st </td><td ><em>burning hands, command </em></td></tr><tr><td >2nd </td><td ><em>blindness/deafness, scorching ray </em></td></tr><tr><td >3rd </td><td ><em>fireball, stinking cloud </em></td></tr><tr><td >4th </td><td ><em>fire shield, wall of fire </em></td></tr><tr><td >5th </td><td ><em>flame strike, hallow </em></td></tr></table>
<h4 id='DarkOnesBlessing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dark One’s Blessing </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). </p>
<h4 id='DarkOnesOwnLuck'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dark One’s Own Luck </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to  </p>
<p>add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.  Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.  </p>
<h4 id='FiendishResilience'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Fiendish Resilience   </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.  </p>
<h4 id='HurlThroughHell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hurl Through Hell  </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.  At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.  Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.  </p>
<h4 id='YourPactBoon'><b>Your Pact Boon   </b></h4>
<p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.  </p>
<p><b><em>Pact of the Chain. </em></b> Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.  </p>
<p><b><em>Pact of the Blade. </em></b> If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.  </p>
<p><b><em>Pact of the Tome. </em></b> Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.  </p>

<h3 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting </b></span></h3>
<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. </p>
<h4 id='Cantrips'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cantrips </b></span></h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. </p>
<h4 id='Spellbook'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellbook </b></span></h4>
<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. </p>
<h4 id='PreparingandCastingSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Preparing and Casting Spells  </b></span></h4>
<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.   You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell  <em>magic missile, </em> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.  You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability  </b></span></h4>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  </p>
<p><b>SpellsaveDC </b>=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  </p>
<p><b>Spellattackmodifier </b>=your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  </p>
<h4 id='RitualCasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ritual Casting   </b></span></h4>
<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingFocus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Focus  </b></span></h4>
<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.  </p>
<h4 id='LearningSpellsof1stLevelandHigher'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher </b></span></h4>
<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). </p>
<h3 id='ArcaneRecovery'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Arcane Recovery </b></span></h3>
<p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. </p>
<p>For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. </p>
<h3 id='ArcaneTradition'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Arcane Tradition </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. </p>
<p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScoreImprovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Score Improvement </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. </p>
<h3 id='SpellMastery'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Mastery </b></span></h3>
<p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. </p>
<p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. </p>
<h3 id='SignatureSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Signature Spells  </b></span></h3>
<p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.  If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.  </p>
<h2 id='ArcaneTraditions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Arcane Traditions  </b></span></h2>
<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.  The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.  </p>
<h3 id='SchoolofEvocation'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>School of Evocation   </b></span></h3>
<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.  </p>
<h4 id='EvocationSavant'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Evocation Savant  </b></span></h4>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.  </p>
<h4 id='SculptSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sculpt Spells  </b></span></h4>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. </p>
<h4 id='PotentCantrip'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Potent Cantrip </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. </p>
<h4 id='EmpoweredEvocation'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Empowered Evocation </b></span></h4>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. </p>
<h4 id='Overchannel'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Overchannel </b></span></h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. </p>
<p>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use </p>
<p>this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by </p>
<p>1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. </p>
<h4 id='YourSpellbook'><b>Your Spellbook </b></h4>
<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the </p>
<p>multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>
<p><b><em>Copying a Spell into the Book. </em></b>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. </p>
<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. </p>
<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you  </p>
<p>expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.  </p>
<p><b><em>Replacing the Book. </em></b> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.  </p>
<p><b><em>The Book’s Appearance. </em></b> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt--edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.  </p>
<h1 id='Beyond1stLevel'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Beyond 1st Level   </b></span></h1>
<p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called  </p>
<p><b>gaining a level </b>.  When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.  Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).  When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.  The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.  </p>

<h2 id='Multiclassing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Multiclassing </b></span></h2>
<p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. </p>
<p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. </p>
<p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original </p>
<p>class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. </p>
<h3 id='Prerequisites'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Prerequisites </b></span></h3>
<p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. </p>
<h4 id='MulticlassingPrerequisites'><b>Multiclassing Prerequisites </b>  </h4>

<h3 id='ExperiencePoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Experience Points   </b></span></h3>
<p>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.  </p>
<h3 id='HitPointsandHitDice'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hit Points and Hit Dice   </b></span></h3>
<p>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.  You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.  </p>
<h3 id='ProficiencyBonus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Proficiency Bonus   </b></span></h3>
<p>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.  </p>
<h3 id='Proficiencies'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Proficiencies  </b></span></h3>
<p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.  </p>

<h3 id='ClassFeatures'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Class Features </b></span></h3>
<p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. </p>
<h4 id='ChannelDivinity'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Channel Divinity </b></span></h4>
<p>If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. </p>
<h4 id='ExtraAttack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Extra Attack </b></span></h4>
<p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. </p>
<h4 id='UnarmoredDefense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Unarmored Defense </b></span></h4>
<p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class. </p>
<h4 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting </b></span></h4>
<p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass  </p>
<p>but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.  </p>
<p><b><em>Spells Known and Prepared. </em></b> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.   Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.  </p>
<p><b><em>Spell Slots.  </em></b>You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.  If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like  <em>burning hands </em>, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.   For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.  </p>
<p><b><em>Pact Magic.  </em></b>If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.  </p>

<h2 id='Alignment'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Alignment </b></span></h2>
<p>A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. </p>
<p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. </p>
<p><b>Lawful good </b>(LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good. </p>
<p><b>Neutral good </b>(NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes </p>
<p>are neutral good. </p>
<p><b>Chaotic good </b>(CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good. </p>
<p><b>Lawful neutral </b> (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.  </p>
<p><b>Neutral </b> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.  </p>
<p><b>Chaotic neutral </b> (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.  </p>
<p><b>Lawful evil </b> (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.  </p>
<p><b>Neutral evil </b> (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.  </p>
<p><b>Chaotic evil </b> (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.  </p>
<h4 id='AlignmentintheMultiverse'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Alignment in the Multiverse   </b></span></h4>
<p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.  The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)  Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.  Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are  </p>
<p><b>unaligned </b>. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.  </p>
<h2 id='Languages'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Languages </b></span></h2>
<p>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet. </p>
<p>Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids. </p>
<p>Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another. </p>

<h2 id='Inspiration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Inspiration </b></span></h2>
<p>Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you. </p>
<h3 id='GainingInspiration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Gaining Inspiration   </b></span></h3>
<p>Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.  You either have inspiration or you don’t-you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.  </p>
<h3 id='UsingInspiration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Using Inspiration   </b></span></h3>
<p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.  Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.  </p>
<h2 id='Backgrounds'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Backgrounds  </b></span></h2>
<p>Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.  Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is  <em>what changed </em>? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have  <em>more </em>money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?  The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.  </p>
<h4 id='Proficiencies'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Proficiencies  </b></span></h4>
<p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).  </p>
<p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”). </p>
<p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he </p>
<p>or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead. </p>
<h4 id='Languages'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Languages </b></span></h4>
<p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.” </p>
<h4 id='Equipment'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Equipment </b></span></h4>
<p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background. </p>
<h4 id='SuggestedCharacteristics'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Suggested Characteristics </b></span></h4>
<p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. </p>
<h4 id='CustomizingaBackground'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Customizing a Background </b></span></h4>
<p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character </p>
<p>or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from </p>
<p>your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one. </p>
<h3 id='Acolyte'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Acolyte </b></span></h3>
<p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power. </p>
<p> Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.  </p>
<p><b>Skill Proficiencies: </b> Insight, Religion  </p>
<p><b>Languages:  </b>Two of your choice  </p>
<p><b>Equipment:  </b>A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp  </p>
<h4 id='FeatureShelteroftheFaithful'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful   </b></span></h4>
<p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.  You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.  </p>
<h4 id='SuggestedCharacteristics'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Suggested Characteristics  </b></span></h4>
<p>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.  </p>

<p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).  With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.  One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn.  One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.  In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.  A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.  </p>

<h2 id='SellingTreasure'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Selling Treasure  </b></span></h2>
<p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.  </p>
<p><b><em>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. </em></b>As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. </p>
<p><b><em>Magic Items. </em></b>Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such. </p>
<p><b><em>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. </em></b>These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Trade Goods. </em></b>On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency. </p>
<h2 id='Armor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Armor </b></span></h2>
<p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. </p>
<p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds. </p>
<p><b><em>Armor Proficiency.  </em></b>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t </p>
<p>cast spells. </p>
<p><b><em>Armor Class (AC). </em></b>Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class. </p>
<p><b><em>Heavy Armor.  </em></b>Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.  </p>
<p><b><em>Stealth. </em></b> If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.  </p>
<p><b><em>Shields. </em></b> A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.  </p>
<h3 id='LightArmor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Light Armor   </b></span></h3>
<p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  </p>
<p><b><em> Padded.  </em></b>Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.  </p>
<p><b><em>Leather. </em></b> The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.  </p>
<p><b><em>Studded Leather. </em></b> Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.  </p>
<h3 id='MediumArmor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Medium Armor   </b></span></h3>
<p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  </p>
<p><b><em>Hide. </em></b> This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.   </p>
<p><b><em>Chain Shirt. </em></b> Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers. </p>
<p><b><em>Scale Mail. </em></b>This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets. </p>
<p><b><em>Breastplate. </em></b>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered. </p>
<p><b><em>Half Plate. </em></b>Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. </p>
<p>It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. </p>
<h3 id='HeavyArmor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Heavy Armor </b></span></h3>
<p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. </p>
<p>Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative. </p>
<p><b><em>Ring Mail. </em></b>This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor. </p>
<p><b><em>Chain Mail. </em></b>Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets. </p>
<p><b><em>Splint. </em></b>This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints. </p>
<p><b><em>Plate. </em></b>Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body. </p>

<p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.  </p>
<p><b><em>Don.  </em></b>This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.  </p>
<p><b><em>Doff.  </em></b>This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.  </p>

<h2 id='Weapons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Weapons  </b></span></h2>
<p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.  The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A  </p>
<p><b>melee weapon </b> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a  </p>
<p><b>ranged weapon </b> is used to attack a target at a distance.  </p>
<h3 id='WeaponProficiency'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Weapon Proficiency  </b></span></h3>
<p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are  </p>
<p><b>simple </b> and  </p>
<p><b>martial </b>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors </p>
<p>use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. </p>
<p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. </p>
<h3 id='WeaponProperties'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Weapon Properties </b></span></h3>
<p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table. </p>
<p><b><em>Ammunition. </em></b>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. </p>
<p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat </p>
<p>the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. </p>
<p><b><em>Finesse. </em></b>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. </p>
<p><b><em>Heavy. </em></b> Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.   </p>
<p><b><em>Light. </em></b> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.  </p>
<p><b><em>Loading. </em></b> Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.  </p>
<p><b><em>Range. </em></b> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.  </p>
<p><b><em>Reach. </em></b> This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.  </p>
<p><b><em>Special. </em></b> A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).   </p>
<p><b><em>Thrown. </em></b> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.  </p>
<p><b><em>Two-Handed.  </em></b>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.  </p>
<p><b><em>Versatile. </em></b> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.  </p>
<h4 id='ImprovisedWeapons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Improvised Weapons  </b></span></h4>
<p>Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. </p>
<p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. </p>
<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. </p>
<h4 id='SilveredWeapons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Silvered Weapons </b></span></h4>
<p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective. </p>
<h4 id='SpecialWeapons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Special Weapons </b></span></h4>
<p>Weapons with special rules are described here. </p>
<p><b><em>Lance. </em></b>You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted. </p>
<p><b><em>Net. </em></b>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until </p>
<p>it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. </p>
<p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. </p>

<h2 id='AdventuringGear'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Adventuring Gear  </b></span></h2>
<p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.  </p>
<p><b><em>Acid.  </em></b>As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Alchemist’s Fire.  </em></b>This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. </p>
<p><b><em>Antitoxin. </em></b>A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. </p>
<p><b><em>Arcane Focus. </em></b>An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item-designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A  </p>
<p>sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ball Bearings.  </em></b>As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.  </p>
<p><b><em>Block and Tackle. </em></b> A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.  </p>
<p><b><em>Book.  </em></b>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).  </p>
<p><b><em>Caltrops.  </em></b>As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.  </p>
<p><b><em>Candle.  </em></b>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.  </p>
<p><b><em>Case, Crossbow Bolt.  </em></b>This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.  </p>
<p><b><em>Case, Map or Scroll.  </em></b>This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.  </p>
<p><b><em>Chain.  </em></b>A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.  </p>
<p><b><em>Climber’s Kit.  </em></b>A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.  </p>
<p><b><em>Component Pouch. </em></b> A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).  </p>
<p><b><em>Crowbar.  </em></b>Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.  </p>
<p><b><em>Druidic Focus. </em></b>A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. </p>
<p><b><em>Fishing Tackle.  </em></b>This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow </p>
<p>netting. </p>
<p><b><em>Healer’s Kit.  </em></b>This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. </p>
<p><b><em>Holy Symbol.  </em></b>A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. </p>
<p><b><em>Holy Water.  </em></b>As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. </p>
<p>A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. </p>
<p><b><em>Hunting Trap.  </em></b>When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature. </p>
<p><b><em>Lamp.  </em></b>A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.  </p>
<p><b><em>Lantern, Bullseye.  </em></b>A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.  </p>
<p><b><em>Lantern, Hooded.  </em></b>A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.  </p>
<p><b><em>Lock.  </em></b>A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.  </p>
<p><b><em>Magnifying Glass.  </em></b>This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.  </p>
<p><b><em>Manacles.  </em></b>These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.  </p>
<p><b><em>Mess Kit.  </em></b>This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.  </p>
<p><b><em>Oil.  </em></b>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.  </p>
<p><b><em>Poison, Basic.  </em></b>You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. </p>
<p><b><em>Potion of Healing.  </em></b>A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. </p>
<p><b><em>Pouch.  </em></b>A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).  </p>
<p><b><em>Quiver.  </em></b>A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. </p>
<p><b><em>Ram, Portable.  </em></b>You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage </p>
<p>on this check. </p>
<p><b><em>Rations.  </em></b>Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. </p>
<p><b><em>Rope.  </em></b>Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. </p>
<p><b><em>Scale, Merchant’s.  </em></b>A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. </p>
<p><b><em>Spellbook.  </em></b>Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. </p>
<p><b><em>Spyglass.  </em></b>Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. </p>
<p><b><em>Tent.  </em></b>A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. </p>
<p><b><em>Tinderbox.  </em></b>This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. </p>
<p><b><em>Torch.  </em></b>A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. </p>

<h4 id='EquipmentPacks'><b>Equipment Packs   </b></h4>
<p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.  </p>
<p><b><em>Burglar’s Pack (16 gp). </em></b> Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.  </p>

<h2 id='Tools'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Tools  </b></span></h2>
<p>A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood. </p>

<p><b><em>Artisan’s Tools.  </em></b>These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan’s tools requires a separate proficiency. </p>
<p><b><em>Disguise Kit.  </em></b>This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.  </p>
<p><b><em>Forgery Kit.  </em></b>This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.  </p>
<p><b><em>Gaming Set.  </em></b>This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.  </p>
<p><b><em>Herbalism Kit.  </em></b>This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and  <em>potions of healing. </em></p>
<p><b><em>Musical Instrument.  </em></b>Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.  </p>
<p><b><em>Navigator’s Tools.  </em></b>This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.  </p>
<p><b><em>Poisoner’s Kit.  </em></b>A poisoner’s kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.  </p>

Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks. </p>
<h2 id='MountsandVehicles'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mounts and Vehicles </b></span></h2>
<p>A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to </p>
<p>carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity. </p>
<p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together. </p>
<p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself. </p>
<p><b><em>Barding.  </em></b>Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much. </p>
<p><b><em>Saddles.  </em></b>A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount. </p>
<p><b><em>Vehicle Proficiency.  </em></b>If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances. </p>
<p><b><em>Rowed Vessels.  </em></b>Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land. </p>

<p>Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).  Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.  </p>

<h2 id='Expenses'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Expenses </b></span></h2>
<p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others. </p>
<h3 id='LifestyleExpenses'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Lifestyle Expenses </b></span></h3>
<p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls. </p>
<p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career. </p>
<p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections. </p>
<h4 id='LifestyleExpenses'><b>Lifestyle Expenses </b>  </h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Lifestyle </b></th><th ><b>Price/Day </b></th></tr><tr><td >Wretched </td><td >- </td></tr><tr><td >Squalid </td><td >1 sp </td></tr></table>

<p><b><em> Wretched. </em></b> You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.  </p>
<p><b><em>Squalid.  </em></b>You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.  </p>
<p><b><em>Poor.  </em></b>A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.  </p>
<p><b><em>Modest. </em></b> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.  </p>
<p><b><em>Comfortable.  </em></b>Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.  </p>
<p><b><em>Wealthy.  </em></b>Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants. </p>
<p><b><em>Aristocratic.  </em></b>You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant. </p>
<h4 id='SelfSufficiency'><b>Self-Sufficiency </b></h4>
<p>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of </p>
<p>whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by </p>
<p>hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear. </p>
<p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time--consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle. </p>
<h3 id='FoodDrinkandLodging'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Food, Drink, and Lodging </b></span></h3>

<h3 id='Services'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Services   </b></span></h3>
<p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.  Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the  <em>secret chest </em> spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.  Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.  </p>
<h4 id='Services'><b>Services </b>  </h4>

<p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers. </p>
<h3 id='SpellcastingServices'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Services </b></span></h3>
<p>People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs. </p>
<p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as  </p>
<p><em>cure wounds </em>or  <em>identify </em>, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement. </p>
<h1 id='Feats'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Feats   </b></span></h1>
<p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.  At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.  You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow-perhaps by a withering curse-you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.  </p>
<h3 id='Grappler'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Grappler   </b></span></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher  </em>You’ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:  </p>
<p>•You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling. </p>
<p>•You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends. </p>

<p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:  </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Strength </b>, measuring physical power </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Dexterity </b>, </p>
<p>  measuring agility </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Constitution </b>, measuring endurance </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Intelligence </b>, measuring reasoning and memory </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Wisdom </b>, measuring perception and insight </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Charisma </b>, measuring force of personalityIs a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.  </p>
<h2 id='AbilityScoresandModifiers'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Scores and Modifiers  </b></span></h2>
<p>Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.  </p>
<h4 id='AbilityScoresandModifiers'><b>Ability Scores and Modifiers  </b></h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Score </b></th><th ><b>Modifier </b></th></tr><tr><td >1 </td><td >−5 </td></tr><tr><td >2-3 </td><td >−4 </td></tr><tr><td >4-5 </td><td >−3 </td></tr><tr><td >6-7 </td><td >−2 </td></tr><tr><td >8-9 </td><td >−1 </td></tr><tr><td >10-11 </td><td >+0 </td></tr><tr><td >12 - 13 </td><td >+1 </td></tr><tr><td >14 - 15 </td><td >+2 </td></tr><tr><td >16 - 17 </td><td >+3 </td></tr><tr><td >18 - 19 </td><td >+4 </td></tr><tr><td >20 - 21 </td><td >+5 </td></tr><tr><td >22 - 23 </td><td >+6 </td></tr><tr><td >24 - 25 </td><td >+7 </td></tr><tr><td >26 - 27 </td><td >+8 </td></tr><tr><td >28 - 29 </td><td >+9 </td></tr><tr><td >30 </td><td >+10 </td></tr></table>
<p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down). </p>
<p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores. </p>
<h2 id='Advantageand'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Advantage and  </b></span></h2>
<h2 id='Disadvantage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Disadvantage </b></span></h2>
<p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When </p>
<p>that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. </p>
<p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, </p>
<p>you still roll only one additional d20. </p>
<p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage. </p>
<p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. </p>
<p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The  </p>
<p>GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.  </p>
<h2 id='ProficiencyBonus'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Proficiency Bonus  </b></span></h2>
<p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.  Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.  Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.  By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.  In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.  </p>
<h2 id='AbilityChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Checks  </b></span></h2>
<p>An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.  For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.  </p>
<h4 id='TypicalDifficultyClasses'><b>Typical Difficulty Classes </b>  </h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Task Difficulty </b></th><th ><b>DC </b></th></tr><tr><td >Very easy </td><td >5 </td></tr><tr><td >Easy </td><td >10 </td></tr><tr><td >Medium </td><td >15 </td></tr><tr><td >Hard </td><td >20 </td></tr><tr><td >Very hard </td><td >25 </td></tr><tr><td >Nearly impossible </td><td >30 </td></tr></table>
<p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM. </p>
<h3 id='Contests'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Contests </b></span></h3>
<p>Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal-for example, when </p>
<p>a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. </p>
<p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. </p>
<p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. </p>
<h3 id='Skills'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Skills </b></span></h3>
<p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an  </p>
<p>ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)  For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.  The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.  </p>
<h4 id='Strength'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Strength  </b></span></h4>
<p>•Athletics </p>
<h4 id='Dexterity'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dexterity  </b></span></h4>

<h4 id='Intelligence'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Intelligence  </b></span></h4>
<p>•Arcana </p>
<p>•History </p>

<p>•Survival </p>
<h4 id='Charisma'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Charisma  </b></span></h4>
<p>•Deception </p>
<p>•Intimidation </p>
<p>•Performance </p>
<p>•PersuasionSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check. </p>
<p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. </p>
<h4 id='VariantSkillswithDifferentAbilities'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities </b></span></h4>
<p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma. </p>
<h3 id='PassiveChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Passive Checks </b></span></h3>
<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster. </p>
<p>Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check: </p>
<p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check </p>
<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a  </p>
<p><b>score </b>. </p>
<p> For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.  The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.  </p>
<h3 id='WorkingTogether'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Working Together   </b></span></h3>
<p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.  </p>
<h4 id='GroupChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Group Checks  </b></span></h4>
<p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.  Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.  </p>
<h2 id='UsingEachAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Using Each Ability  </b></span></h2>
<p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.  </p>
<h3 id='Strength'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Strength </b></span></h3>
<p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force. </p>
<h4 id='StrengthChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Strength Checks </b></span></h4>
<p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks. </p>
<p><b><em>Athletics.  </em></b>Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities: </p>
<p>•You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff,avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off. </p>
<p>•You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump. </p>
<p>•You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming. </p>
<p><b><em>Other Strength Checks.  </em></b>The GM might also call fora Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following: </p>
<p>•Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door </p>
<p>•Break free of bonds </p>
<p>•Push through a tunnel that is too small </p>
<p>•Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it </p>
<p>•Tip over a statue </p>
<p>•Keep a boulder from rolling </p>
<h4 id='AttackRollsandDamage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Attack Rolls and Damage </b></span></h4>
<p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack. </p>
<h4 id='LiftingandCarrying'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Lifting and Carrying </b></span></h4>
<p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Carrying Capacity.  </em></b>Your carrying capacity is your Strength </p>
<p>score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough  </p>
<p>that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.  </p>
<p><b><em>Push, Drag, or Lift.  </em></b>You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.  </p>
<p><b><em>Size and Strength. </em></b> Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.  </p>
<h4 id='VariantEncumbrance'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Variant: Encumbrance  </b></span></h4>
<p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.   If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are  </p>
<p><b>encumbered </b>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.  If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead  </p>
<p><b>heavily encumbered </b>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.  </p>
<h3 id='Dexterity'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dexterity   </b></span></h3>
<p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.  </p>
<h4 id='DexterityChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dexterity Checks  </b></span></h4>
<p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.  </p>
<p><b><em>Acrobatics.  </em></b>Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.  </p>
<p><b><em>Sleight of Hand.  </em></b>Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket. </p>
<p><b><em>Stealth.  </em></b>Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip </p>
<p>away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard. </p>
<p><b><em>Other Dexterity Checks.  </em></b>The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following: </p>
<p>•Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent </p>
<p>•Steer a chariot around a tight turn </p>
<p>•Pick a lock </p>
<p>•Disable a trap </p>
<p>•Securely tie up a prisoner </p>
<p>•Wriggle free of bonds </p>
<p>•Play a stringed instrument </p>
<p>•Craft a small or detailed object </p>
<h4 id='AttackRollsandDamage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Attack Rolls and Damage </b></span></h4>
<p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier. </p>
<h4 id='ArmorClass'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Armor Class </b></span></h4>
<p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class. </p>
<h4 id='Initiative'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Initiative </b></span></h4>
<p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat. </p>
<h4 id='Hiding'><b>Hiding </b></h4>
<p>The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence. </p>
<p>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. </p>
<p>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet. </p>
<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a  </p>
<p>creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.  </p>
<p><b><em>Passive Perception. </em></b>When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st--level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.  </p>
<p><b><em>What Can You See? </em></b> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be  </p>
<p><b>lightly </b>or </p>
<p><b>heavily obscured </b>, as explained in "The Environment.”  </p>
<h3 id='Constitution'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Constitution   </b></span></h3>
<p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.  </p>
<h4 id='ConstitutionChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Constitution Checks  </b></span></h4>
<p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.  The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  </p>
<p>•Hold your breath </p>
<p>•March or labor for hours without rest </p>
<p>•Go without sleep </p>
<p>•Survive without food or water </p>
<p>•Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go </p>
<h4 id='HitPoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hit Points  </b></span></h4>
<p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.  If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7. </p>
<h3 id='Intelligence'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Intelligence </b></span></h3>
<p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason. </p>
<h4 id='IntelligenceChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Intelligence Checks </b></span></h4>
<p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Arcana.  </em></b>Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. </p>
<p><b><em>History.  </em></b>Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations. </p>
<p><b><em>Investigation.  </em></b>When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check. </p>
<p><b><em>Nature.  </em></b>Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles. </p>
<p><b><em>Religion.  </em></b>Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures </p>
<p>your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults. </p>
<p><b><em>Other Intelligence Checks.  </em></b>The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following: </p>
<p>•Communicate with a creature without using words </p>
<p>•Estimate the value of a precious item </p>
<p>•Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard </p>
<p>•Forge a document </p>
<p>•Recall lore about a craft or trade </p>
<p>•Win a game of skill </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability  </b></span></h4>
<p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.  </p>
<h3 id='Wisdom'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Wisdom  </b></span></h3>
<p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.   </p>
<h4 id='WisdomChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Wisdom Checks  </b></span></h4>
<p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.  </p>
<p><b><em> Animal Handling.  </em></b>When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.  </p>
<p><b><em> Insight.  </em></b>Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.  </p>
<p><b><em> Medicine.  </em></b>A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.  </p>
<p><b><em> Perception.  </em></b>Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.  </p>
<p><b><em> Survival.  </em></b>The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.  </p>
<p><b><em>Other Wisdom Checks.  </em></b>The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  </p>
<p>•Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow </p>
<p>•Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability </b></span></h4>
<p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast. </p>
<h3 id='Charisma'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Charisma </b></span></h3>
<p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality. </p>
<h4 id='CharismaChecks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Charisma Checks </b></span></h4>
<p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Deception.  </em></b>Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception </p>
<p>can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Intimidation.  </em></b>When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Performance.  </em></b>Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Persuasion.  </em></b>When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include  </p>
<p>convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.  </p>
<p><b><em>Other Charisma Checks.  </em></b>The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  </p>
<p>•Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,and gossip </p>
<p>•Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation </p>
<h4 id='SpellcastingAbility'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting Ability  </b></span></h4>
<p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.  </p>
<h2 id='SavingThrows'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Saving Throws  </b></span></h2>
<p>A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.  </p>
<h2 id='Time'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Time  </b></span></h2>
<p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of  </p>
<p><b>minutes </b>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.  In a city or wilderness, a scale of  </p>
<p><b>hours </b> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.  For long journeys, a scale of  </p>
<p><b>days </b> works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.  In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on  </p>
<p><b>rounds </b>, a 6-second span of time.  </p>
<h2 id='Movement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Movement  </b></span></h2>
<p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.  The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”  Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.  </p>
<h3 id='Speed'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Speed   </b></span></h3>
<p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.   </p>
<p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day. </p>
<h4 id='TravelPace'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Travel Pace </b></span></h4>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b><em>Forced March.  </em></b></span><span style='color: DarkRed;'>The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A). </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b><em>Mounts and Vehicles.  </em></b></span><span style='color: DarkRed;'>For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a  </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'><em>carpet of flying </em></span><span style='color: DarkRed;'>, allow you to travel more swiftly. </span></p>

<h4 id='DifficultTerrain'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Difficult Terrain  </b></span></h4>
<p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult terrain.  You move at half speed in difficult terrain-moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.  </p>
<h3 id='SpecialTypesofMovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Special Types of Movement  </b></span></h3>
<p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.  </p>
<h4 id='ClimbingSwimmingandCrawling'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling  </b></span></h4>
<p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.  </p>
<h4 id='Jumping'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Jumping  </b></span></h4>
<p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.  </p>
<p><b><em>Long Jump.  </em></b>When you make a long jump, you cover a  number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it. When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.  </p>
<p><b><em>High Jump.  </em></b>When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your </p>
<p>GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can. </p>
<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times </p>
<p>your height. </p>
<h2 id='TheEnvironment'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Environment  </b></span></h2>
<p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.  </p>
<h3 id='Falling'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Falling   </b></span></h3>
<p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.  </p>
<h3 id='Suffocating'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Suffocating   </b></span></h3>
<p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).  When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.  For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.  </p>
<h3 id='VisionandLight'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Vision and Light   </b></span></h3>
<p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring-noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.  A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a  </p>
<p><b>lightly obscured </b> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  A  </p>
<p><b>heavily obscured </b> area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix PH-A) when trying to see something in that area.  The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.  </p>
<p><b>Bright light </b> lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. </p>
<p><b>Dim light </b>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light. </p>
<p><b>Darkness </b>creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness. </p>
<h4 id='Blindsight'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Blindsight </b></span></h4>
<p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense. </p>
<h4 id='Darkvision'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Darkvision </b></span></h4>
<p>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
<h4 id='Truesight'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Truesight </b></span></h4>
<p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane. </p>
<h3 id='FoodandWater'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Food and Water </b></span></h3>
<p>Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount. </p>
<h4 id='Food'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Food </b></span></h4>
<p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.  </p>
<p>Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.  A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.   A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.  </p>
<h4 id='Water'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Water  </b></span></h4>
<p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.  If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.  </p>
<h3 id='InteractingwithObjects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Interacting with Objects   </b></span></h3>
<p>A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.  For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.  Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.  A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.  </p>
<h2 id='Resting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Resting </b></span></h2>
<p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.  </p>
<p>Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. </p>
<h3 id='ShortRest'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Short Rest </b></span></h3>
<p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. </p>
<p>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below. </p>
<h3 id='LongRest'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Long Rest </b></span></h3>
<p>A longrest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at </p>
<p>least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. </p>
<p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. </p>
<p>A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. </p>
<h2 id='BetweenAdventures'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Between Adventures  </b></span></h2>
<p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.  In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.  </p>
<h3 id='LifestyleExpenses'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Lifestyle Expenses   </b></span></h3>
<p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.   Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.  </p>
<h3 id='DowntimeActivities'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Downtime Activities   </b></span></h3>
<p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.   Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.  </p>
<h4 id='Crafting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Crafting  </b></span></h4>
<p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. </p>
<p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value </p>
<p>of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself. </p>
<p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a </p>
<p>suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp. </p>
<p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. </p>
<h4 id='PracticingaProfession'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Practicing a Profession </b></span></h4>
<p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. </p>
<p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead. </p>
<p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead. </p>
<h4 id='Recuperating'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Recuperating </b></span></h4>
<p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. </p>
<p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results: </p>
<p>•End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points. </p>
<p>•For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you. </p>
<h2 id='TheOrderofCombat'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Order of Combat  </b></span></h2>
<p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A  </p>
<p><b>round </b> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a  </p>
<p><b>turn </b>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.  </p>
<h4 id='CombatStepbyStep'><b>Combat Step by Step   </b></h4>
<p><b>1.Determine surprise. </b> The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.  </p>
<p><b>2.Establish positions. </b> The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers` marching order or their stated positions inthe room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are-how far away and in what direction. </p>
<p><b>3.Roll initiative. </b> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants` turns. </p>
<p><b>4.Take turns. </b> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.  </p>
<p><b>5.Begin the next round. </b> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.  </p>
<h3 id='Surprise'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Surprise  </b></span></h3>
<p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.  The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.  If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.  </p>
<h3 id='Initiative'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Initiative </b></span></h3>
<p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. </p>
<p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round. </p>
<p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first. </p>
<h3 id='YourTurn'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Your Turn </b></span></h3>
<p>On your turn, you can </p>
<p><b>move </b>a distance up to your speed and </p>
<p><b>take one action </b>. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed-sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet. </p>
<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the </p>
<p>“Actions in Combat” section. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. </p>
<p>The “Movement and Position” section gives the rules for your move. </p>
<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your </p>
<p>turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.” </p>
<h4 id='BonusActions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bonus Actions </b></span></h4>
<p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t </p>
<p>have a bonus action to take. </p>
<p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available. </p>
<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is  </p>
<p>specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.  </p>
<h4 id='OtherActivityonYourTurn'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Other Activity on Your Turn  </b></span></h4>
<p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.  You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.  You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.  If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.  The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.  </p>
<h3 id='Reactions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Reactions   </b></span></h3>
<p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction.  When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.  </p>
<h2 id='MovementandPosition'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Movement and Position  </b></span></h2>
<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.  On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.  Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.  </p>
<h3 id='BreakingUpYourMove'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Breaking Up Your Move </b></span></h3>
<p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet. </p>
<h4 id='MovingbetweenAttacks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Moving between Attacks </b></span></h4>
<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For </p>
<p>example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again. </p>
<h4 id='UsingDifferentSpeeds'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Using Different Speeds </b></span></h4>
<p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move. </p>
<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the  </p>
<p><em>fly </em>spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more. </p>
<h3 id='DifficultTerrain'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Difficult Terrain </b></span></h3>
<p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain. </p>
<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. </p>
<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain. </p>
<h3 id='BeingProne'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Being Prone </b></span></h3>
<p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix PH-A. </p>
<p>You can  </p>
<p><b>drop prone </b>without using any of your speed.  </p>
<p><b>Standing up </b>takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.  </p>
<p>For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.  To move while prone, you must  </p>
<p><b>crawl </b> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.  </p>
<h4 id='InteractingwithObjectsAroundYou'><b>Interacting with Objects Around You   </b></h4>
<p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:  </p>
<p>•draw or sheathe a sword </p>
<p>•open or close a door </p>
<p>•withdraw a potion from your backpack </p>
<p>•pick up a dropped axe </p>
<p>•take a bauble from a table </p>
<p>•remove a ring from your finger </p>
<p>•stuff some food into your mouth </p>
<p>•plant a banner in the ground </p>
<p>•fish a few coins from your belt pouch </p>
<p>•drink all the ale in a flagon </p>
<p>•throw a lever or a switch </p>
<p>•pull a torch from a sconce </p>
<p>•take a book from a shelf you can reach </p>
<p>•extinguish a small flame </p>
<p>•don a mask </p>
<p>•pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head </p>
<p>•put your ear to a door </p>
<p>•kick a small stone </p>
<p>•turn a key in a lock </p>
<p>•tap the floor with a 10--foot pole </p>
<p>•hand an item to another character </p>
<h3 id='MovingAroundOtherCreatures'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Moving Around Other Creatures   </b></span></h3>
<p>You can move through a non hostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.  Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.  If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack.  </p>
<h3 id='FlyingMovement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Flying Movement   </b></span></h3>
<p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the  </p>
<p><em>fly </em>spell. </p>
<h3 id='CreatureSize'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Creature Size </b></span></h3>
<p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories. </p>
<h4 id='SizeCategories'><b>Size Categories </b>  </h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Size </b></th><th ><b>Space </b></th></tr><tr><td >Tiny </td><td >2½ by 2½ ft. </td></tr><tr><td >Small </td><td >5 by 5 ft. </td></tr><tr><td >Medium </td><td >5 by 5 ft. </td></tr><tr><td >Large </td><td >10 by 10 ft. </td></tr><tr><td >Huge </td><td >15 by 15 ft. </td></tr><tr><td >Gargantuan </td><td >20 by 20 ft. or larger </td></tr></table>
<h4 id='Space'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Space </b></span></h4>
<p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them. </p>
<p>A creature’sspace also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. </p>
<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one. </p>
<h4 id='SqueezingintoaSmallerSpace'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Squeezing into a Smaller Space </b></span></h4>
<p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space. </p>
<h2 id='ActionsinCombat'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Actions in Combat  </b></span></h2>
<p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.  When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.  </p>
<h3 id='Attack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Attack   </b></span></h3>
<p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.  With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.  Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.  </p>
<h3 id='CastaSpell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cast a Spell   </b></span></h3>
<p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.  </p>
<h3 id='Dash'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dash   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.  Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.  </p>
<h3 id='Disengage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Disengage   </b></span></h3>
<p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.  </p>
<h3 id='Dodge'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dodge </b></span></h3>
<p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix PH-A) or if your speed drops to 0. </p>
<h3 id='Help'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Help </b></span></h3>
<p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. </p>
<h3 id='Hide'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hide </b></span></h3>
<p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section. </p>
<h3 id='Ready'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ready </b></span></h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. </p>
<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.” </p>
<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round. </p>
<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and  </p>
<p>holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the  <em>web </em> spell and ready  <em>magic missile </em>, your  <em>web </em> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release  <em>magic missile </em> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.  </p>
<h3 id='Search'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Search   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.  </p>
<h3 id='UseanObject'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Use an Object  </b></span></h3>
<p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.  </p>
<h2 id='MakinganAttack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Making an Attack  </b></span></h2>
<p>Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.  </p>
<p><b>1. Choose a target. </b> Pick a target within your attack’srange: a creature, an object, or a location. </p>
<p><b>2. Determine modifiers.  </b>The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target.In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll. </p>
<p><b>3. Resolve the attack.  </b>You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead ofdamage.If there’s ever any question whether somethingyou’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.  </p>
<h3 id='AttackRolls'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Attack Rolls   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block. </p>
<h4 id='ModifierstotheRoll'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Modifiersto the Roll </b></span></h4>
<p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block. </p>
<p><b><em>Ability Modifier.  </em></b>The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. </p>
<p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster. </p>
<p><b><em>Proficiency Bonus.  </em></b>You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell. </p>
<h4 id='Rolling1or20'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rolling 1 or 20 </b></span></h4>
<p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. </p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit. </p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. </p>
<h3 id='UnseenAttackersandTargets'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Unseen Attackers and Targets </b></span></h3>
<p>Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking </p>
<p>in darkness. </p>
<p>When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly. </p>
<p>When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen </p>
<p>and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses. </p>
<h3 id='RangedAttacks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ranged Attacks  </b></span></h3>
<p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.  </p>
<h4 id='Range'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Range  </b></span></h4>
<p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.  If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.  Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.  </p>
<h4 id='RangedAttacksinCloseCombat'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat   </b></span></h4>
<p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.  </p>
<h3 id='MeleeAttacks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Melee Attacks   </b></span></h3>
<p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.  Most creatures have a 5-foot  </p>
<p><b>reach </b> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.  Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an  </p>
<p><b>unarmed strike </b>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 +your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. </p>
<h4 id='OpportunityAttacks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Opportunity Attacks </b></span></h4>
<p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack. </p>
<p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. </p>
<p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion </p>
<p>hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy. </p>
<h4 id='TwoWeaponFighting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Two-Weapon Fighting </b></span></h4>
<p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. </p>
<p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it. </p>
<h4 id='Grappling'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Grappling </b></span></h4>
<p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. </p>
<p>Thetarget of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix PH-A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required). </p>
<p><b><em>Escaping a Grapple.  </em></b>A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check. </p>
<p><b><em>Moving a Grappled Creature.  </em></b>When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.  </p>
<h4 id='ContestsinCombat'><b>Contests in Combat   </b></h4>
<p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.  </p>
<h4 id='ShovingaCreature'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Shoving a Creature  </b></span></h4>
<p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.  The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.  </p>
<h2 id='Cover'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cover  </b></span></h2>
<p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.  There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.  A target with  </p>
<p><b>half cover </b> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.  A target with  </p>
<p><b>three-quarters cover </b> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.  </p>
<p>A target with  </p>
<p><b>total cover </b>can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. </p>
<h2 id='DamageandHealing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Damage and Healing </b></span></h2>
<p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a  </p>
<p><em>fireball </em>spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures. </p>
<h3 id='HitPoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hit Points </b></span></h3>
<p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile. </p>
<p>A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing. </p>
<p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points. </p>
<h3 id='DamageRolls'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Damage Rolls </b></span></h3>
<p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. </p>
<p>Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage. </p>
<p>When attacking with a  </p>
<p><b>weapon </b>, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack </p>
<p>roll-to the damage. A  </p>
<p><b>spell </b>tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. </p>
<p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to  </p>
<p><b>more  </b></p>
<p><b>than one target </b>at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts </p>
<p><em>fireball </em>or a cleric casts  <em>flame strike </em>, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. </p>
<h4 id='CriticalHits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Critical Hits </b></span></h4>
<p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them  </p>
<p>together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.  For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.  </p>
<h4 id='DamageTypes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Damage Types  </b></span></h4>
<p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.  The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.  </p>
<p><b><em>Acid.  </em></b>The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Bludgeoning.  </em></b>Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.  </p>
<p><b><em> Cold.  </em></b>The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Fire.  </em></b>Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Force.  </em></b>Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including  <em>magic missile </em> and  <em>spiritual weapon </em>.  </p>
<p><b><em>Lightning.  </em></b>A  <em>lightning bolt </em> spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Necrotic.  </em></b>Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as  <em>chill touch </em>, withers matter and even the soul.  </p>
<p><b><em>Piercing.  </em></b>Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Poison. </em></b> Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Psychic.  </em></b>Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.   </p>
<p><b><em>Radiant.  </em></b>Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s  <em>flame strike </em> spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.  </p>
<p><b><em>Slashing.  </em></b>Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Thunder.  </em></b>A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the  <em>thunderwave </em> spell, deals thunder damage.  </p>
<h3 id='DamageResistanceand'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Damage Resistance and  </b></span></h3>
<h3 id='Vulnerability'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Vulnerability </b></span></h3>
<p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. </p>
<p>If a creature or an object has  </p>
<p><b>resistance </b>to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has  </p>
<p><b>vulnerability </b>to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. </p>
<p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers </p>
<p>to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, </p>
<p>so the creature takes 10 damage. </p>
<p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters. </p>
<h3 id='Healing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Healing </b></span></h3>
<p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a  </p>
<p><em>cure wounds </em>spell or a  <em>potion of healing </em></p>
<p>can remove damage in an instant. </p>
<p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8. </p>
<p>A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the  </p>
<p><em>revivify </em>spell has restored it to life. </p>
<h3 id='Droppingto0HitPoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dropping to 0 Hit Points </b></span></h3>
<p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections. </p>
<h4 id='InstantDeath'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Instant Death  </b></span></h4>
<p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.  </p>
<h4 id='FallingUnconscious'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Falling Unconscious  </b></span></h4>
<p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.  </p>
<h4 id='DeathSavingThrows'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Death Saving Throws  </b></span></h4>
<p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.  </p>
<p><b><em>Rolling 1 or 20. </em></b> When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.  </p>
<p><b><em>Damage at 0 Hit Points. </em></b> If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.  </p>
<h4 id='StabilizingaCreature'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Stabilizing a Creature  </b></span></h4>
<p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.  You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. </p>
<p>A  </p>
<p><b>stable </b>creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours. </p>
<h4 id='MonstersandDeath'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Monsters and Death </b></span></h4>
<p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws. </p>
<p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters. </p>
<h3 id='KnockingaCreatureOut'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Knocking a Creature Out </b></span></h3>
<p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable. </p>
<h3 id='TemporaryHitPoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Temporary Hit Points </b></span></h3>
<p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. </p>
<p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. </p>
<p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points. </p>
<p>Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. </p>
<p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed  </p>
<p>at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.  </p>
<h2 id='MountedCombat'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mounted Combat  </b></span></h2>
<p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.   A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.  </p>
<h3 id='MountingandDismounting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mounting and Di smounting   </b></span></h3>
<p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.  If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.  </p>
<h3 id='ControllingaMount'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Controlling a Mount   </b></span></h3>
<p>While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes. </p>
<p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the </p>
<p>mount. </p>
<h2 id='UnderwaterCombat'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Underwater Combat </b></span></h2>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>When making a  </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>melee weapon attack </b></span><span style='color: DarkRed;'>, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>A  </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>ranged weapon attack </b></span><span style='color: DarkRed;'>automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart). </span></p>
<p><span style='color: DarkRed;'>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage. </span></p>
<h1 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting   </b></span></h1>
<p>Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.  This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.  </p>
<h2 id='WhatIsaSpell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>What Is a Spell?  </b></span></h2>
<p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.  Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.  Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.  </p>
<h3 id='SpellLevel'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Level   </b></span></h3>
<p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive)  <em>magic missile </em> at 1st level and the earth-shaking  <em>wish </em> at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.  </p>
<h3 id='KnownandPreparedSpells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Known and Prepared Spells  </b></span></h3>
<p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions. </p>
<p>In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level. </p>
<h3 id='SpellSlots'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Slots </b></span></h3>
<p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots. </p>
<p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level </p>
<p>slot. So when Umara casts  <em>magic missile, </em>a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.  </p>
<p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots. </p>
<p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.  </p>
<h4 id='CastingaSpellataHigherLevel'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level </b></span></h4>
<p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts  </p>
<p><em>magic missile </em>using one of her 2nd-level slots, that  </p>
<p><em>magic missile </em>is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into. </p>
<p>Some spells, such as  <em>magic missile </em>and  <em>cure wounds </em></p>
<p>, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description. </p>
<h4 id='CastinginArmor'><b>Casting in Armor </b></h4>
<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting. </p>
<h3 id='Cantrips'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cantrips   </b></span></h3>
<p>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.  </p>
<h3 id='Rituals'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rituals   </b></span></h3>
<p>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.  To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.  </p>
<h2 id='CastingaSpell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Casting a Spell  </b></span></h2>
<p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.  </p>
<h3 id='CastingTime'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Casting T ime  </b></span></h3>
<p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.  </p>
<h4 id='BonusAction'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bonus Action  </b></span></h4>
<p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.  </p>
<h4 id='Reactions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Reactions  </b></span></h4>
<p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. </p>
<h4 id='LongerCastingTimes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Longer Casting Times </b></span></h4>
<p>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over. </p>
<h3 id='Range'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Range </b></span></h3>
<p>The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like  </p>
<p><em>magic missile </em>, the target is a creature. For a spell like  </p>
<p><em>fireball </em>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts. </p>
<p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the  </p>
<p><em>shield </em>spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. </p>
<p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”). </p>
<p>Once a spell is cast,its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise. </p>
<h3 id='Components'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Components </b></span></h3>
<p>A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell. </p>
<h4 id='VerbalV'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Verbal (V) </b></span></h4>
<p>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the  </p>
<p><em>silence </em>spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component. </p>
<h4 id='SomaticS'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Somatic (S) </b></span></h4>
<p>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell  </p>
<p>requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.  </p>
<h4 id='MaterialM'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Material (M)  </b></span></h4>
<p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a  </p>
<p><b>component pouch </b> or a  </p>
<p><b>spellcasting focus </b> (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.  </p>
<h3 id='Duration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Duration   </b></span></h3>
<p>A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.  </p>
<h4 id='Instantaneous'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Instantaneous  </b></span></h4>
<p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.  </p>
<h4 id='Concentration'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Concentration  </b></span></h4>
<p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:  </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Casting another spell that requires concentration.  </b>You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Taking damage. </b> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Being incapacitated or killed. </b>You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell. </p>
<h3 id='Targets'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Targets </b></span></h3>
<p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). </p>
<p>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. </p>
<h4 id='AClearPathtotheTarget'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>A Clear Path to the Target </b></span></h4>
<p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover. </p>
<p>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. </p>
<h4 id='TargetingYourself'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Targeting Yourself </b></span></h4>
<p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. </p>
<h3 id='AreasofEffect'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Areas of Effect </b></span></h3>
<p>Spells such as  <em>burning hands </em>and  <em>cone of cold </em>cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. </p>
<p>A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a  </p>
<p><b>point of origin </b>, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape  </p>
<p>specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.  A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.  </p>
<h4 id='Cone'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cone  </b></span></h4>
<p>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.  A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.  </p>
<h4 id='Cube'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cube  </b></span></h4>
<p>You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.  A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.  </p>
<h4 id='Cylinder'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cylinder  </b></span></h4>
<p>A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.  A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.  </p>
<h4 id='Line'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Line  </b></span></h4>
<p>A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.  A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.  </p>
<h4 id='Sphere'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sphere  </b></span></h4>
<p>You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.  A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.  </p>
<h3 id='SavingThrows'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Saving Throws </b></span></h3>
<p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. </p>
<p>The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers. </p>
<h3 id='AttackRolls'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Attack Rolls </b></span></h3>
<p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. </p>
<p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated. </p>
<h4 id='TheSchoolsofMagic'><b>The Schools of Magic </b></h4>
<p>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. </p>
<p>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools. </p>
<p><b>Abjuration </b>spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence. </p>
<p><b>Conjuration </b>spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to </p>
<p>another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing. </p>
<p><b>Divination </b>spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. </p>
<p><b>Enchantment </b>spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet. </p>
<p><b>Evocation </b>spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others </p>
<p>channel positive energy to heal wounds. </p>
<p><b>Illusion  </b>spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom  </p>
<p>images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.  </p>
<p><b>Necromancy </b> spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as  </p>
<p><em>animate dead </em> is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.  </p>
<p><b>Transmutation </b> spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.  </p>
<h3 id='CombiningMagicalEffects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Combining Magical Effects   </b></span></h3>
<p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap.  For example, if two clerics cast  <em>bless </em> on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.  </p>

<p><b>Range: </b> 60 feet  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>Instantaneous You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).  </p>

<p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire) </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>8 hoursYou set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible. </p>
<p>A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. </p>
<p>An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet. </p>
<h4 id='AlterSelf'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Alter Self </b></span></h4>
<p><em>2nd-level transmutation </em></p>

<p><b>Range: </b>Self </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 1 hourYou assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits </p>

You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any  </p>
<p>time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.  </p>
<p><b><em> Natural Weapons.  </em></b>You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.  </p>
<h4 id='AnimalFriendship'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Animal Friendship  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>1st-level enchantment  </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b> 1 action  </p>
<p><b>Range: </b> 30 feet  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (a morsel of food)  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> 24 hours This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.  </p>
<p><b><em>At Higher Levels. </em></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast t level above 1st.  </p>
<h4 id='AnimalMessenger'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Animal Messenger  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>2nd-level enchantment (ritual)  </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b> 1 action  </p>
<p><b>Range: </b> 30 feet  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (a morsel of food)  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> 24 hours By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.  When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell. </p>
<p><b><em>At Higher Levels. </em></b>If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd. </p>
<h4 id='AnimalShapes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Animal Shapes </b></span></h4>
<p><em>8th-level transmutation </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action </p>
<p><b>Range: </b>30 feet </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 24 hoursYour magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms. </p>
<p>Thetransformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells. </p>
<p>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. </p>
<h4 id='AnimateDead'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Animate Dead </b></span></h4>
<p><em>3rd-level necromancy </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 minute </p>
<p><b>Range: </b>10 feet </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust) </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>InstantaneousThis spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with </p>
<p>a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or  </p>
<p>a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).  On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.  The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.  </p>
<p><b><em> At Higher Levels. </em></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.  </p>
<h4 id='AnimateObjects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Animate Objects  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>5th-level transmutation  </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b> 1 action  </p>
<p><b>Range: </b> 120 feet  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 minute Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.  As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. </p>

<p>An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form. </p>
<p>If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form. </p>
<p><b><em>At Higher Levels. </em></b>If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th. </p>
<h4 id='AntilifeShell'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Antilife Shell </b></span></h4>
<p><em>5th-level abjuration </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action </p>
<p><b>Range: </b>Self (10-foot radius) </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 1 hourA shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration. </p>
<p>The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier. </p>
<p> If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.  </p>
<h4 id='AntimagicField'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Antimagic Field  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>8th-level abjuration  </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b> 1 action  </p>
<p><b>Range: </b> Self (10-foot-radius sphere)  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 hour A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.  Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.  </p>
<p><b><em> Targeted Effects. </em></b> Spells and other magical effects, such as  <em>magic missile </em> and  <em>charm person </em>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.  </p>
<p><b><em> Areas of Magic. </em></b> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as  <em>fireball </em>, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a  <em>wall of fire </em> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.  </p>
<p><b><em> Spells. </em></b> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.  </p>
<p><b><em> Magic Items. </em></b> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a  <em>+1 longsword </em> in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.  </p>
<p><b><em>Magical Travel. </em></b>Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the  </p>
<p><em>rope trick </em>spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. </p>
<p><b><em>Creatures and Objects. </em></b>A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence </p>
<p>in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Dispel Magic. </em></b>Spells and magical effects such as  </p>
<p><em>dispel magic </em>have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different </p>
<p><em>antimagic field </em></p>
<p>spells don’t nullify each other. </p>
<h4 id='AntipathySympathy'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Antipathy/Sympathy </b></span></h4>
<p><em>8th-level enchantment </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 hour </p>
<p><b>Range: </b>60 feet </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the  </p>
<p><em>antipathy </em>effect or a drop of honey for the  </p>
<p><em>sympathy </em>effect) </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>10 daysThis spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Antipathy. </em></b>The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you </p>
<p>designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Sympathy. </em></b>The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it.  </p>
<p>When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target.  If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ending the Effect. </em></b> If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.  A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.  </p>

<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)  </p>

<h4 id='ArcaneHand'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Arcane Hand  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>5th-level evocation  </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b> 1 action  </p>
<p><b>Range: </b> 120 feet  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand. </p>
<p>The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space. </p>
<p>When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Clenched Fist. </em></b>The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Forceful Hand. </em></b>The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Grasping Hand. </em></b>The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Interposing Hand. </em></b>The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>At Higher Levels. </em></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th. </p>

You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting  <em>knock </em> on the object suppresses  <em>arcane lock </em> for 10 minutes.  While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.  </p>

<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (a small square of silk)  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> 24 hours You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.  When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>False Aura.  </em></b>You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as  </p>
<p><em>detect magic </em></p>
<p>, that detect magical auras <em>. </em>You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that </p>
<p>it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Mask.  </em></b>You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a  </p>

<h4 id='AstralProjection'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Astral Projection </b></span></h4>
<p><em>9th-level necromancy </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 hour </p>
<p><b>Range: </b>10 feet </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes) </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>SpecialYou and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age. </p>
<p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. </p>
<p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting </p>
<p>this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects  </p>
<p>that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.  The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.  The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful  <em>dispel magic </em> spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.  If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.  </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> 10 days Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting  <em>contingency </em>, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a  <em>contingency </em> cast with  <em>water breathing </em>might stipulate that  <em>water breathing </em> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.  The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then  <em>contingency </em> ends.  The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one  <em>contingency </em> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another  <em>contingency </em> spell on you ends. Also,  <em>contingency </em> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.  </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 10 minutesUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Flood.  </em></b>You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. </p>
<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with </p>
<p>it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. </p>
<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Part Water.  </em></b>You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Redirect Flow.  </em></b>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if </p>
<p>the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Whirlpool.  </em></b>This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the  </p>
<p>base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.  When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.  The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.  </p>

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.  The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it.

When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 minute For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.  You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.  Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.  You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.  Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.  </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> 8 hours This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, </p>

<p>If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams. </p>
<p>You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.  The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.  When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.  This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.  </p>
<p><b><em>Fissures. </em></b> Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.  A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).  </p>
<p><b><em>Structures. </em></b> The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried. </p>

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.  </p>
<p><b><em> Enlarge. </em></b> The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category-from Medium to Large, for example.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.  Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.  When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again  While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.  As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.  Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.  </p>

(Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. </p>
<p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed. </p>
<p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum. </p>

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.  When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.  A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect.

This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free. </p>
<p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes. </p>

The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.  The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front.

<p>Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains. </p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal.

A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.  Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.  A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.  The GM might allow you to choose different targets.

<p>Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot.

<p><b>Range: </b>Touch </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes) </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. </p>
<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. </p>
<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. </p>
<p> You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.  When you inscribe the glyph, choose  <em>explosive runes </em> or a  <em>spell glyph. </em></p>
<p><b><em> Explosive Runes. </em></b> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.  </p>
<p><b><em> Spell Glyph. </em></b> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.  </p>
<p><b><em> At Higher Levels. </em></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an  <em>explosive runes </em> glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a  <em>spell glyph </em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the  <em>glyph of warding. </em></p>

You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.  When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target. </p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. </p>
<p><b><em>Burial. </em></b>The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere </p>
<p>of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. </p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Chaining. </em></b>Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then. </p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal. </p>
<p><b><em>Hedged Prison. </em></b>The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. </p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade. </p>
<p><b><em>Minimus Containment.  </em></b>The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. </p>
<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Slumber. </em></b>The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs. </p>
<p><b><em>Ending the Spell. </em></b>During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition </p>
<p>is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. </p>
<p> A  <em>dispel magic </em> spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.  You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.  </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>Until dispelled </p>
<p>Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.  You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a  <em>protection from evil and good </em> or  <em>magic circle </em>spell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.  Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.  Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.  While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.  If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies. When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.  </p>

Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> 24 hours You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.  Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.  You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it.

<p><b>Duration: </b>Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature </p>
<p>(like a troglodyte’s stench). </p>
<p>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. </p>
<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. </p>

Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.  Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.  The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.  Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.  </p>

<p><b>Range: </b> 30 feet  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 minute You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.  While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.  You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.  A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.  A  <em>remove curse </em> or  <em>greater restoration </em> spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.  </p>
<p><b><em>At Higher Levels </em></b>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level). </p>

Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.  This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain.

<p><b>Range: </b> 60 feet  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V, S  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Instantaneous You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).  When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.  Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.  As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.  After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>24 hoursWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted  </p>
<p><em>magic circle </em></p>
<p>in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell. </p>
<p>A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> Instantaneous You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.  Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify.

<p>The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality. </p>
<p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. </p>
<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> 10 minutes A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A  <em>rod of cancellation </em> destroys a  <em>prismatic wall </em>, but an  <em>antimagic field </em> has no effect on it.  </p>

<p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.  When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:  </p>

The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.  You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).  </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>Until dispelledYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes. </p>
<p>When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again. </p>
<p>The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase. </p>
<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature. </p>

<p> You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.  You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.

<p>This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.

<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 minute A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.  Nothing-not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects-can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.  The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.  A  <em>disintegrate </em> spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.  </p>

<p>This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. </p>
<p>It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life. </p>
<p>This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts. </p>
<p>Comingback from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. </p>
<p>Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. </p>

<p><em>5th-level illusion </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action </p>
<p><b>Range: </b>30 feet </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>8 hoursThis spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell. </p>
<p>The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner. </p>
<p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. </p>
<p>A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>1 roundYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with </p>
<p>which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables  </p>
<p>creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.  You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.  </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> Until dispelled By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.  If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.  You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.  </p>

<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 1 hour You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.  Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form. </p>
<p>You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. </p>
<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. </p>
<p>When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. </p>
<p>During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value. </p>

<p>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. </p>
<p> Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

<p><b>Duration: </b> Until dispelled You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.  The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.  If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

<p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.  An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.  If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.

<p>Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy.

<p>Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical. </p>

Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell. </p>
<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. </p>
<p> You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.  If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.  </p>

<p><em>7th-level abjuration </em></p>
<p><b>Casting Time: </b>1 minute </p>
<p><b>Range: </b>Touch </p>
<p><b>Components: </b>V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b>Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover </p>
<p>an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. </p>
<p>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. </p>
<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching </p>
<p>within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. </p>
<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. </p>
<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. </p>

<p><b><em> Fear. </em></b> Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.  </p>
<p><b><em> Hopelessness. </em></b> Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.  </p>
<p><b><em> Insanity. </em></b> Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.  </p>
<p><b><em> Pain. </em></b> Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.  </p>
<p><b><em> Sleep. </em></b> Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.  </p>

You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.  </p>
<p><b><em> Creature. </em></b> You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air. </p>
<p>On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Object. </em></b>You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell. </p>

If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell. </p>
<p>You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial. </p>

<p><b><em> Familiarity. </em></b> “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.  “Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.  “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.  </p>
<p><b><em> On Target. </em></b> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.  </p>
<p><b><em> Off Target. </em></b> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Similar Area. </em></b>You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Mishap. </em></b>The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time). </p>

<p><em>5th-level conjuration </em></p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>1 roundAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. </p>
<p>Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute. </p>
<p>You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for  </p>
<p>one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.  </p>

The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality. </p>
<p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number </p>
<p>of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. </p>
<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions. </p>
<p>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b>1 hourThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack.

The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. </p>

<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side). </p>
<p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by  </p>

<p>If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. </p>
<p>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </p>

<p><b>Components: </b> V, S, M (a small block of granite)  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.  The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.  If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.  The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.  </p>

<p><b>Duration:  </b>Concentration, up to 1 hour You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.  If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.  The webs are flammable.

<p><b>Range: </b> Self  </p>
<p><b>Components: </b> V  </p>
<p><b>Duration: </b> Instantaneous  <em>Wish </em> is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.  Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:  </p>
<p>•You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no morethan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. </p>
<p>•You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the  <em>greater restoration </em> spell. </p>
<p>•You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. </p>
<p>•You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack. </p>
<p>•You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a  </p>
<p><em>wish </em>spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, afoe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to usethe reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. </p>
<p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast  </p>
<p><em>wish </em>ever again if you suffer this stress. </p>

<p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.  An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.  </p>
<h2 id='Traps'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Traps  </b></span></h2>
<p>Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.  </p>
<p><b>Mechanical traps </b> include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate.  </p>
<p><b>Magic traps </b> are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as  <em>glyph of warding </em> and  <em>symbol </em> that function as traps.  </p>
<h3 id='TrapsinPlay'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Traps in Play   </b></span></h3>
<p>When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.  </p>
<h4 id='TriggeringaTrap'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Triggering a Trap  </b></span></h4>
<p>Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the  <em>glyph of warding  </em>spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.  </p>
<h4 id='DetectingandDisablingaTrap'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Detecting and Disabling a Trap  </b></span></h4>
<p>Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.  A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an </p>
<p>Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage. </p>
<p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic </p>
<p>trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,  </p>
<p><em>dispel magic </em>has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use  </p>
<p><em>dispel magic </em>. </p>
<p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt. </p>
<p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required. </p>
<p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a </p>
<p>trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield. </p>
<p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap. </p>
<h4 id='TrapEffects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Trap Effects  </b></span></h4>
<p>The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.  The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.  A trap intended to be a  </p>
<p><b>setback </b> is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a  </p>
<p><b>dangerous </b> trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A  </p>
<p><b>deadly </b> trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.  </p>

<h4 id='ComplexTraps'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Complex Traps  </b></span></h4>
<p>Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.  When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.  For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.  </p>
<h3 id='SampleTraps'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sample Traps </b></span></h3>
<p>The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order. </p>
<h4 id='CollapsingRoof'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Collapsing Roof </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Mechanical trap </em></p>
<p>This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place. </p>
<p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers. </p>
<p>Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger. </p>
<p>The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse. </p>
<p>When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain. </p>
<h4 id='FallingNet'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Falling Net </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Mechanical trap </em></p>
<p>This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling. </p>
<p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers. </p>
<p>When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10  </p>
<p>Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.  </p>
<h4 id='FireBreathingStatue'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Fire-Breathing Statue  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Magic trap  </em>This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.  The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as  <em>detect magic </em>, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.  The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful  <em>dispel magic </em> (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.  </p>
<h4 id='Pits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Pits  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Mechanical trap  </em>Four basic pit traps are presented here.  </p>
<p><b><em>Simple Pit. </em></b> A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.  The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).  </p>
<p><b><em>Hidden Pit </em></b>. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.  A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.  When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.  </p>
<p>Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the  </p>
<p><em>arcane lock </em>spell or similar magic. </p>
<p><b><em>Locking Pit. </em></b>This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. </p>
<p>A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In </p>
<p>some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit. </p>
<p><b><em>Spiked Pit. </em></b>This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the </p>
<p>pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </p>
<h4 id='PoisonDarts'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Poison Darts </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Mechanical trap </em></p>
<p>When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts. </p>
<p>The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching. </p>
<p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8  </p>
<p>bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  </p>
<h4 id='PoisonNeedle'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Poison Needle  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Mechanical trap  </em>A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.  When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.  A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.  </p>
<h4 id='RollingSphere'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rolling Sphere  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Mechanical trap  </em>When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.  With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.  Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. </p>
<p>The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving. </p>
<p>As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat. </p>
<h4 id='SphereofAnnihilation'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sphere of Annihilation </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Magic trap </em></p>
<p>Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated. </p>
<p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a  </p>
<p><em>sphere of annihilation </em></p>
<p>that can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal  </p>
<p><em>sphere of annihilation </em></p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the  </p>
<p><em>sympathy </em>aspect of the  <em>antipathy/sympathy </em></p>
<p>spell. A successful  <em>dispel magic </em>(DC 18) removes this enchantment. </p>
<h2 id='Diseases'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Diseases  </b></span></h2>
<p>A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.  A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of  <em>lesser restoration </em>. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.  A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren’t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.  </p>
<h3 id='SampleDiseases'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sample Disease s  </b></span></h3>
<p>The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.  </p>
<h4 id='CackleFever'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Cackle Fever  </b></span></h4>
<p>This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”  Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.  Any event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success. </p>
<p>Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or </p>
<p>also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours. </p>
<p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly </p>
<p>determined form of indefinite madness, as described later. </p>
<h4 id='SewerPlague'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sewer Plague </b></span></h4>
<p>Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs. </p>
<p>When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. </p>
<p>It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest. </p>
<p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. </p>
<h4 id='SightRot'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sight Rot </b></span></h4>
<p>This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim. </p>
<p>A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end  </p>
<p>of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as  <em>lesser restoration </em> or  <em>heal </em>.  Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.  </p>
<h2 id='Madness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Madness  </b></span></h2>
<p>In a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.  </p>
<h3 id='GoingMad'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Going Mad   </b></span></h3>
<p>Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as  <em>contact other plane </em> and  <em>symbol </em>, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells <em>. </em> Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.  Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.  </p>
<h3 id='MadnessEffects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Madness Effects   </b></span></h3>
<p>Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.  A character afflicted with  </p>
<p><b>short-term madness </b> is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.  A character afflicted with  </p>
<p><b>long-term madness </b> is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.  A character afflicted with  </p>
<p><b>indefinite madness </b>gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.  </p>

<h3 id='CuringMadness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Curing Madness   </b></span></h3>
<p>A  <em>calm emotions </em> spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a  <em>lesser restoration </em> spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness,  <em>remove curse </em> or  <em>dispel evil </em> might also prove effective. A  <em>greater restoration </em> spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.  </p>
<h2 id='Objects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Objects  </b></span></h2>
<p>When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.  For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.  </p>
<h4 id='StatisticsforObjects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Statistics for Objects  </b></span></h4>
<p>When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Armor Class. </em></b> An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.  </p>
<h4 id='ObjectArmorClass'><b>Objec t Armor Class  </b></h4>

<p><b><em>Hit Points. </em></b> An object’s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.  </p>
<h4 id='ObjectHitPoints'><b>Object Hit Points   </b></h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Size </b></th><th ><b>Fragile </b></th><th ><b>Resilient </b></th></tr><tr><td >Tiny (bottle, lock) </td><td >2 (1d4) </td><td >5 (2d4) </td></tr><tr><td >Small (chest, lute) </td><td >3 (1d6) </td><td >10 (3d6) </td></tr><tr><td >Medium (barrel, chandelier) </td><td >4 (1d8) </td><td >18 (4d8) </td></tr><tr><td >Large (cart, 10 --ft.--by--10--ft. window) </td><td >5 (1d10) </td><td >27 (5d10) </td></tr></table>
<p><b><em>Huge and Gargantuan Objects.  </em></b>Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an  </p>
<p><em>earthquake </em>spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points. </p>
<p><b><em>Objects and Damage Types. </em></b>Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment. </p>
<p><b><em>Damage Threshold.  </em></b>Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold </p>
<p>has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points. </p>
<h2 id='Poisons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Poisons  </b></span></h2>
<p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures. Poisons come in the following four types.  </p>
<p><b><em>Contact. </em></b> Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.  </p>
<p><b><em>Ingested.  </em></b>A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.  </p>
<p><b><em>Inhaled.  </em></b>These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.  </p>
<p><b><em>Injury.  </em></b>Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.  </p>

<h3 id='SamplePoisons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sample Poisons  </b></span></h3>
<p>Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.  </p>
<p><b><em>Assassin’s Blood (Ingested). </em></b>A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t poisoned. </p>
<p><b><em>Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled). </em></b>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends. </p>
<p><b><em>Crawler Mucus (Contact). </em></b>This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. </p>
<p><b><em>Drow Poison (Injury). </em></b>This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place </p>
<p>far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. </p>
<p><b><em>Essence of Ether (Inhaled). </em></b>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is </p>
<p>unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. </p>
<p><b><em>Malice (Inhaled). </em></b>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded. </p>
<p><b><em>Midnight Tears (Ingested). </em></b>A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </p>
<p><b><em>Oil of Taggit (Contact). </em></b>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage. </p>
<p><b><em>Serpent Venom (Injury). </em></b> This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  </p>
<p><b><em>Torpor (Ingested). </em></b> A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.  </p>
<p><b><em>Truth Serum (Ingested). </em></b> A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can’t knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a  <em>zone of truth </em> spell.  </p>
<p><b><em>Wyvern Poison (Injury). </em></b> This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  </p>
<h1 id='MagicItems'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Magic Items  </b></span></h1>
<p>Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways.  </p>
<h2 id='Attunement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Attunement  </b></span></h2>
<p>Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class’s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.  Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.  Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.  An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one  <em>ring of protection </em> at a time.  A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed. </p>
<h2 id='WearingandWieldingItems'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Wearing and Wielding Items </b></span></h2>
<p>Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding </p>
<p>it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held. </p>
<p>In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn’t adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk. </p>
<p>When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t wear boots. </p>
<h3 id='MultipleItemsoftheSameKind'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Multiple Items of the Same Kind </b></span></h3>
<p>Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks. </p>
<h3 id='PairedItems'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Paired Items </b></span></h3>
<p>Items that come in pairs-such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either. </p>
<h2 id='ActivatinganItem'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Activating an Item </b></span></h2>
<p>Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each  </p>
<p>item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.  If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item.  </p>
<h3 id='CommandWord'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Command Word   </b></span></h3>
<p>A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can’t be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.  </p>
<h3 id='Consumables'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Consumables   </b></span></h3>
<p>Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.  </p>
<h3 id='Spells'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spells   </b></span></h3>
<p>Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.  A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature-your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. </p>
<h3 id='Charges'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Charges   </b></span></h3>
<p>Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. </p>
<h2 id='MagicItemsAZ'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Magic Items A-Z </b></span></h2>
<p>Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item’s description gives the item’s name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties. </p>
<h4 id='AdamantineArmor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Adamantine Armor </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon </em></p>
<p>This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. </p>
<h4 id='Ammunition12or3'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3 </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) </em></p>
<p>You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical. </p>
<h4 id='AmuletofHealth'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Amulet of Health </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) </em></p>

<h4 id='AmuletofthePlanes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Amulet of the Planes </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the  </p>
<p><em>plane shift </em>spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence. </p>
<h4 id='AnimatedShield'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Animated Shield  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)  </em>While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.  </p>
<h4 id='ApparatusoftheCrab'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Apparatus of the Crab  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary  </em>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.  The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:  </p>
<p><b>Armor Class: </b> 20  </p>
<p><b>Hit Points: </b> 200  </p>
<p><b>Speed: </b> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren’t extended)  </p>
<p><b>Damage Immunities:  </b>poison, psychic To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.  The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.  A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.  </p>

<p><b><em>Curse. </em></b> This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an  <em>identify </em> spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the  <em>remove curse </em> spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).  </p>
<h4 id='ArrowCatchingShield'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Arrow-Catching Shield  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)  </em>You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.  </p>
<h4 id='ArrowofSlaying'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Arrow of Slaying  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (arrow), very rare  </em>An  <em>arrow of slaying </em> is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both  <em>arrows of dragon slaying </em> and  <em>arrows of blue dragon slaying </em>. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an  <em>arrow of slaying </em> takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.  Once an  <em>arrow of slaying </em> deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.  Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as  <em>bolts of slaying </em> meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.  </p>
<h4 id='BagofBeans'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bag of Beans </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare </em></p>
<p>Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains. </p>
<p>If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving </p>
<p>throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. </p>
<p>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect. </p>

<h4 id='BagofDevouring'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bag of Devouring   </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare  </em>This bag superficially resembles a  <em>bag of holding  </em>but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.  The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.  Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.  If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.  </p>
<h4 id='BagofHolding'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bag of Holding  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon  </em>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. </p>
<p>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. </p>
<p>Placing a  <em>bag of holding </em>inside an extradimensional space created by a  </p>
<p><em>handy haversack </em></p>
<p>,  <em>portable hole </em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened. </p>
<h4 id='BagofTricks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Bag of Tricks </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound. </p>
<p>You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object </p>
<p>lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color. </p>
<p>The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. </p>
<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. </p>
<p>Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn. </p>

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.  An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.  </p>

<p>speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls. </p>
<p>While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it. </p>
<p>After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground  </p>
<p>at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.  </p>
<h4 id='DecanterofEndlessWater'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Decanter of Endless Water  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon  </em>This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.  You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:  </p>
<p>•“Stream” produces 1 gallon of water. </p>
<p>•“Fountain” produces 5 gallons of water. </p>
<p>•“Geyser” produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, youcan target an object that isn’t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds.The object is either knocked over or pushed up to15 feet away from you. </p>
<h4 id='DeckofIllusions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Deck of Illusions  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon  </em>This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.  The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.  An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent. </p>
<p>The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again. </p>

<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary </em></p>
<p>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two. </p>
<p>Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as  </p>
<p>soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.  Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.  </p>

<p><b><em>Fool. </em></b>You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level. </p>

<h4 id='Defender'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Defender </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. </p>
<p>The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it. </p>
<h4 id='DemonArmor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Demon Armor </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal.

<p><b><em>Curse. </em></b>Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the  </p>

<h4 id='DimensionalShackles'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dimensional Shackles  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare  </em>You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.  </p>
<h4 id='DragonScaleMail'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dragon Scale Mail  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)  </em>Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.  While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).  Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.  </p>

<h4 id='DragonSlayer'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dragon Slayer  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare  </em>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns. </p>
<h4 id='DustofDisappearance'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dust of Disappearance </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed </p>
<p>when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature. </p>
<h4 id='DustofDryness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dust of Dryness </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible. </p>
<p>Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic. </p>
<p>An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </p>
<h4 id='DustofSneezingandChoking'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dust of Sneezing and Choking </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be  </p>
<p><em>dust of disappearance </em>, and an  </p>
<p><em>identify </em>spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use. </p>
<p>When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The  </p>
<p><em>lesser restoration </em></p>
<p>spell can also end the effect on a creature. </p>
<h4 id='DwarvenPlate'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dwarven Plate  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (plate), very rare  </em>While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.  </p>
<h4 id='DwarvenThrower'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Dwarven Thrower  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf)  </em>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.  </p>
<h4 id='EfficientQuiver'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Efficient Quiver  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon  </em>Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.  You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.  </p>
<h4 id='EfreetiBottle'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Efreeti Bottle  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare  </em>This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efre eti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.  </p>

<h4 id='ElementalGem'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Elemental Gem </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the  </p>
<p><em>conjure elemental </em></p>
<p>spell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell. </p>

<p><em>Armor (chain shirt), rare </em></p>
<p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor. </p>
<h4 id='EversmokingBottle'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Eversmoking Bottle </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet. </p>
<p>The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round. </p>
<h4 id='EyesofCharming'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Eyes of Charming </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the  </p>
<p><em>charm person </em>spell  </p>
<p>(save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.  </p>
<h4 id='EyesofMinuteSeeing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Eyes of Minute Seeing   </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon  </em>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.  </p>
<h4 id='EyesoftheEagle'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Eyes of the Eagle  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)  </em>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.  </p>
<h4 id='FeatherToken'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Feather Token  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare  </em>This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.  </p>

<p><b><em>Anchor. </em></b> You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.  </p>
<p><b><em>Bird. </em></b> You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can’t attack.

<p>commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.  The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it.

Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success. </p>
<h4 id='InstantFortress'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Instant Fortress </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare </em></p>
<p>You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty. </p>
<p>The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the  </p>
<p><em>knock </em>spell and similar magic, such as that of a </p>
<p><em>chime of opening </em>. </p>
<p> Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.  The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a  <em>wish </em> spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of <em> wish </em> causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.  </p>

Many types of  <em>Ioun stone </em> exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.  </p>
<p><b><em>Absorption (Very Rare). </em></b> While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.  </p>
<p><b><em>Agility (Very Rare). </em></b> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.  </p>
<p><b><em>Awareness (Rare). </em></b> You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.  </p>
<p><b><em>Fortitude (Very Rare). </em></b> Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.  </p>
<p><b><em>Greater Absorption (Legendary). </em></b>While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. </p>
<p>Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it. </p>
<p><b><em>Insight (Very Rare). </em></b>Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head. </p>
<p><b><em>Intellect (Very Rare). </em></b>Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head. </p>
<p><b><em>Leadership (Very Rare). </em></b>Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head. </p>
<p><b><em>Mastery (Legendary). </em></b>Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head. </p>
<p><b><em>Protection (Rare). </em></b>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head. </p>
<p><b><em>Regeneration (Legendary). </em></b>You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. </p>
<p><b><em>Reserve (Rare). </em></b>This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM. </p>
<p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. </p>
<p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space. </p>
<p><b><em>Strength (Very Rare). </em></b>Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head. </p>
<p><b><em>Sustenance (Rare). </em></b>You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head. </p>
<h4 id='IronBandsofBinding'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Iron Bands of Binding  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare  </em>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.  Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.  A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.  </p>
<h4 id='IronFlask'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Iron Flask  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary  </em>This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.  You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  An  <em>identify </em> spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.  </p>

<h4 id='JavelinofLightning'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Javelin of Lightning </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (javelin), uncommon </em></p>
<p>This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage. </p>
<p>The javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon. </p>
<h4 id='LanternofRevealing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Lantern of Revealing </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius. </p>
<h4 id='LuckBlade'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Luck Blade  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)  </em>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.  </p>
<p><b><em>Luck.  </em></b>If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.  </p>
<p><b><em>Wish. </em></b> The sword has 1d4 - 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the  <em>wish </em> spell from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.  </p>
<h4 id='MaceofDisruption'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mace of Disruption  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)  </em>When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.  While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.  </p>
<h4 id='MaceofSmiting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mace of Smiting  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (mace), rare  </em>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.  When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it’s a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.  </p>
<h4 id='MaceofTerror'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mace of Terror  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)  </em>This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. </p>
<p>The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. </p>
<h4 id='MantleofSpellResistance'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mantle of Spell Resistance </b></span></h4>

<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare </em></p>
<p>This book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic.

If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.

<h4 id='ManualofGolems'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Manual of Golems </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare </em></p>
<p>This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can’t use a  </p>
<p><em>manual of golems </em>and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage. </p>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>d20 </b></th><th ><b>Golem </b></th><th ><b>Time </b></th><th ><b>Cost </b></th></tr><tr><td >1 - 5 </td><td >Clay </td><td >30 days </td><td >65,000 gp </td></tr><tr><td >6 - 17 </td><td >Flesh </td><td >60 days </td><td >50,000 gp </td></tr><tr><td >18 </td><td >Iron </td><td >120 days </td><td >100,000 gp </td></tr><tr><td >19 - 20 </td><td >Stone </td><td >90 days </td><td >80,000 gp </td></tr></table>
<p> To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.  Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.  </p>
<h4 id='ManualofQuicknessofAction'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Manual of Quickness of Action   </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare  </em>This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.  </p>
<h4 id='MarvelousPigments'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Marvelous Pigments  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare  </em>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.   Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.  When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.  Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.  If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.  </p>
<h4 id='MedallionofThoughts'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Medallion of Thoughts </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the  </p>
<p><em>detect thoughts </em>spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. </p>
<h4 id='MirrorofLifeTrapping'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mirror of Life Trapping </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare </em></p>
<p>When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. </p>
<p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again. </p>
<p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically. </p>
<p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature </p>
<p>is confined to the cell until freed. </p>
<p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. </p>
<p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally. </p>
<p>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature  </p>
<p>trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.  </p>
<h4 id='MithralArmor'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Mithral Armor  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon  </em>Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.  </p>
<h4 id='NecklaceofAdaptation'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Necklace of Adaptation  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)  </em>While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as  <em>cloudkill </em> and  <em>stinking cloud </em> effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).  </p>
<h4 id='NecklaceofFireballs'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Necklace of Fireballs  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare  </em>This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level  <em>fireball </em>spell (save DC 15).  You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the  <em>fireball </em> by 1 for each bead beyond the first.  </p>
<h4 id='NecklaceofPrayerBeads'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Necklace of Prayer Beads  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)  </em>This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.  Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn. </p>

<h4 id='NineLivesStealer'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Nine Lives Stealer </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. </p>
<p>The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property. </p>
<h4 id='Oathbow'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Oathbow </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have </p>
<p>wronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn. </p>
<p>When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage. </p>
<p>While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons. </p>
<h4 id='OilofEtherealness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Oil of Etherealness </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Potion, rare </em></p>
<p>Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional  </p>
<p>vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the  <em>etherealness </em> spell for 1 hour.  </p>
<h4 id='OilofSharpness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Oil of Sharpness  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Potion, very rare  </em>This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultra thin silver shards.

<h4 id='OilofSlipperiness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Oil of Slipperiness  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Potion, uncommon  </em>This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a  <em>freedom of movement </em> spell for 8 hours.  Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the  <em>grease </em> spell in that area for 8 hours.  </p>
<h4 id='PearlofPower'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Pearl of Power  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)  </em>While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can`t be used again until the next dawn.  </p>
<h4 id='PeriaptofHealth'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Periapt of Health  </b></span></h4>

<p><em>Wondrous item, rare  </em>This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage. </p>
<h4 id='PeriaptofWoundClosure'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Periapt of Wound Closure </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) </em></p>

<p><em>Potion, uncommon </em></p>
<p>The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart. </p>
<h4 id='PipesofHaunting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Pipes of Haunting </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon </em></p>
<p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. </p>
<h4 id='PipesoftheSewers'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Pipes of the Sewers </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. </p>
<p>The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called  </p>
<p>swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.  </p>

<h4 id='PortableHole'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Portable Hole  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare  </em>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a  <em>portable hole </em> and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the  <em>portable hole </em> creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open  <em>portable hole </em> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a  <em>portable hole </em> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the  </p>
<p><em>portable hole </em>or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed  </p>
<p><em>portable hole </em>can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. </p>
<p>Placing a  <em>portable hole </em>inside an extradimensional space created by a  </p>
<p><em>bag of holding </em>,  <em>handy haversack </em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened. </p>

<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)  </em>This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil.

<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon  </em>This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment. The robe has two of each of the following patches:  </p>
<p>•Dagger </p>

<h4 id='RodofAbsorption'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rod of Absorption </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell. </p>
<p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored. </p>
<p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot. </p>
<p> A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.  </p>
<h4 id='RodofAlertness'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rod of Alertness  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)  </em>This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.  </p>
<p><b><em>Alertness. </em></b> While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.  </p>
<p><b><em>Spells.  </em></b>While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it:  <em>detect evil and good </em>,  <em>detect magic </em>,  <em>detect poison and disease </em>, or  <em>see invisibility. </em></p>
<p><b><em>Protective Aura. </em></b> As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.  The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.  </p>
<h4 id='RodofLordlyMight'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rod of Lordly Might  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Rod, legendary (requires attunement)  </em>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.  </p>
<p><b><em>Six Buttons. </em></b> You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  If you press  </p>
<p><b>button 1 </b>, the rod becomes a  <em>flame tongue </em>, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.  If you press  </p>
<p><b>button 2 </b>, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  If you press  </p>
<p><b>button 3 </b>, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.If you press  </p>
<p><b>button 4 </b>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form. </p>
<p>If you press  </p>
<p><b>button 5 </b>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. </p>
<p>If you press  </p>
<p><b>button 6 </b>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it. </p>
<p><b><em>Drain Life. </em></b>When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the </p>
<p>rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </p>
<p><b><em>Paralyze. </em></b>When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </p>
<p><b><em>Terrify. </em></b>While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. </p>
<h4 id='RodofRulership'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rod of Rulership </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its  </p>
<p>trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.  </p>
<h4 id='RodofSecurity'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rod of Security  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Rod, very rare  </em>While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.  For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).  When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.  </p>
<h4 id='RopeofClimbing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rope of Climbing   </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon  </em>This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.  If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.  </p>
<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. </p>
<h4 id='RopeofEntanglement'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Rope of Entanglement </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare </em></p>
<p>This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving </p>
<p>throw or become restrained. </p>
<p>You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope. </p>
<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. </p>
<h4 id='ScarabofProtection'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Scarab of Protection </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person: </p>
<p>•You have advantage on saving throws against spells. </p>
<p>•The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, youcan use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended. </p>
<h4 id='ScimitarofSpeed'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Scimitar of Speed </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement) </em></p>

<h4 id='Shield12or3'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Shield, +1, +2, or +3  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)  </em>While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.  </p>
<h4 id='ShieldofMissileAttraction'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Shield of Missile Attraction   </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)  </em>While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.  </p>
<p><b><em>Curse. </em></b> This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the  <em>remove curse </em> spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.  </p>
<h4 id='SlippersofSpiderClimbing'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Slippers of Spider Climbing  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)  </em>While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.  </p>
<h4 id='SovereignGlue'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sovereign Glue  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary  </em>This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with  <em>oil of slipperiness. </em> When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.  One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of  <em>universal solvent </em> or  <em>oil of etherealness </em>, or with a  <em>wish </em> spell.  </p>
<h4 id='SpellScroll'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spell Scroll  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Scroll, varies  </em>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost. </p>
<p>If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. </p>
<p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table. </p>

<p>A wizard spell on a  <em>spell scroll </em>can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a  </p>
<p><em>spell scroll </em>, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 +the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the  </p>

<h4 id='SpellguardShield'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellguard Shield </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement) </em></p>

<h4 id='SphereofAnnihilation'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sphere of Annihilation </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary </em></p>
<p>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it. </p>
<p>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a  </p>
<p><em>sphere of annihilation </em>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage. </p>
<p> The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.  If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.  If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the  <em>gate </em> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a  <em>portable hole </em>, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.  </p>

The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.  If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can’t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff’s intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.  If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed.

<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary </em></p>
<p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter. </p>
<p>You can use an action to unfold and place the  <em>well of many worlds </em></p>
<p>on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once  </p>

<h4 id='WingedBoots'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Winged Boots  </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)  </em>While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.  The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren’t in use.  </p>
<h4 id='WingsofFlying'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Wings of Flying   </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)  </em>While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word.

When they disappear, you can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.  </p>
<h2 id='SentientMagicItems'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Sentient Magic Items  </b></span></h2>
<p>Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.  Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.  </p>
<h3 id='CreatingSentientMagicItems'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Creating Sentient Magic Items   </b></span></h3>
<p>When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.  </p>
<h4 id='Abilities'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Abilities </b></span></h4>
<p>A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. </p>
<h4 id='Communication'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Communication </b></span></h4>
<p>A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table. </p>

<h4 id='SpecialPurpose'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Special Purpose </b></span></h4>
<p>You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You  </p>

<h3 id='Conflict'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Conflict   </b></span></h3>
<p>A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:  </p>
<p>•The item insists on being carried or worn at all times. </p>
<p>•The item demands that its wielder dispose ofanything the item finds repugnant. </p>
<p>•The item demands that its wielder pursue theitem’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals. </p>
<p>•The item demands to be given to someone else.If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’swishes, the item can do any or all of the following:  </p>
<p>•Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it. </p>
<p>•Suppress one or more of its activated properties. </p>
<p>•Attempt to take control of its wielder.If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn. </p>
<h2 id='Artifacts'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Artifacts </b></span></h2>
<h4 id='OrbofDragonkind'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Orb of Dragonkind </b></span></h4>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) </em></p>
<p>Ages past,elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five  </p>
<p><em>Orbs of Dragonkind </em></p>
<p>(or  <em>Dragon Orbs </em>) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic. </p>
<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow </p>
<p>some measure of control over dragons. </p>
<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb. </p>
<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. </p>
<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma </p>
<p>check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. </p>
<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts  </p>
<p><em>suggestion </em>on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the  </p>
<p>world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.  </p>
<p><b><em>Random Properties. </em></b> An  <em>Orb of Dragonkind </em> has the following random properties:  </p>
<p>•2 minor beneficial properties </p>
<p>•1 minor detrimental property </p>
<p>•1 major detrimental property </p>
<p><b><em>Spells. </em></b> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18)from it:  <em>cure wounds </em> (5th-level version, 3charges),  <em>daylight </em> (1 charge),  <em>death ward </em> (2 charges),or  <em>scrying </em> (3 charges).You can also use an action to cast the  <em>detect magic  </em>spell from the orb without using any charges.  </p>
<p><b><em>Call Dragons. </em></b> While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.  </p>
<p><b><em>Destroying an Orb. </em></b> An  <em>Orb of Dragonkind </em> appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A  <em>disintegrate </em> spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.  </p>

<h4 id='ModifyingCreatures'><b>Modifying Creatures   </b></h4>
<p>Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a  </p>
<p><b>variant </b> or  </p>
<p><b>template </b>, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.  </p>
<h3 id='Type'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Type   </b></span></h3>
<p>A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an  <em>arrow of dragon slaying </em> deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.  The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.  </p>
<p><b>Aberrations </b> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.  </p>
<p><b>Beasts </b> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals. </p>
<p><b>Celestials </b>are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi. </p>
<p><b>Constructs </b>are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures. </p>
<p><b>Dragons </b>are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons. </p>
<p><b>Elementals  </b>are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers. </p>
<p><b>Fey </b>are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs. </p>
<p><b>Fiends </b>are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths. </p>
<p><b>Giants </b> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.  </p>
<p><b>Humanoids </b> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.  </p>
<p><b>Monstrosities </b> are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.  </p>
<p><b>Oozes </b> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.  </p>
<p><b>Plants </b> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.  </p>
<p><b>Undead </b> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.  </p>
<h4 id='Tags'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Tags  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the  <em>humanoid (orc) </em> type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag. </p>
<h3 id='Alignment'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Alignment </b></span></h3>
<p>A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack </p>
<p>characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the  </p>
<p><em>Player’s Handbook </em>for descriptions of the different alignments. </p>
<p>The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change </p>
<p>a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you. </p>
<p>Some creatures can have  </p>
<p><b>any alignment </b>. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature. </p>
<p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are  </p>
<p><b>unaligned </b>, which means they don’t have an alignment. </p>
<h3 id='ArmorClass'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Armor Class </b></span></h3>
<p>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value. </p>
<h3 id='HitPoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Hit Points </b></span></h3>
<p>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the  </p>
<p><em>Player’s Handbook. </em></p>
<p>A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½). </p>
<p>A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table. </p>
<h4 id='HitDicebySize'><b>Hit Dice by Size   </b></h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Monster Size </b></th><th ><b>Hit Die </b></th><th ><b>Average HP per Die </b></th></tr><tr><td >Tiny </td><td >d4 </td><td >2½ </td></tr><tr><td >Small </td><td >d6 </td><td >3½ </td></tr><tr><td >Medium </td><td >d8 </td><td >4½ </td></tr><tr><td >Large </td><td >d10 </td><td >5½ </td></tr><tr><td >Huge </td><td >d12 </td><td >6½ </td></tr><tr><td >Gargantuan </td><td >d20 </td><td >10½ </td></tr></table>
<p> A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).  </p>
<h3 id='Speed'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Speed   </b></span></h3>
<p>A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the  <em>Player’s Handbook.  </em> All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.  Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.  </p>
<h4 id='Burrow'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Burrow  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.  </p>
<h4 id='Climb'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Climb  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.  </p>
<h4 id='Fly'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Fly  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to  </p>
<p><b>hover </b>, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the  <em>Player’s Handbook </em>). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.  </p>
<h4 id='Swim'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Swim  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.  </p>
<h3 id='AbilityScores'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ability Scores </b></span></h3>
<p>Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the  </p>
<p><em>Player’s Handbook. </em></p>
<h3 id='SavingThrows'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Saving Throws  </b></span></h3>
<p>The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent. </p>
<p>A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). </p>
<h4 id='ProficiencyBonusbyChallengeRating'><b>Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating </b>  </h4>

<h3 id='Skills'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Skills </b></span></h3>
<p>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. </p>
<p>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a  </p>
<p>monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.  </p>
<h3 id='VulnerabilitiesResistancesandImmunities'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities   </b></span></h3>
<p>Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.  </p>
<h3 id='Senses'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Senses   </b></span></h3>
<p>The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.  </p>
<h4 id='Blindsight'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Blindsight  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.   Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.  If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.   </p>
<h4 id='Darkvision'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Darkvision  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.  </p>
<h4 id='ArmorWeaponandToolProficiencies'><b>Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies   </b></h4>
<p>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. See the  </p>
<p><em>Player’s Handbook </em> for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.  </p>
<h4 id='Tremorsense'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Tremorsense </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many </p>
<p>burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense. </p>
<h4 id='Truesight'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Truesight </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range. </p>
<h3 id='Languages'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Languages </b></span></h3>
<p>The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “-” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.  </p>
<h4 id='Telepathy'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Telepathy </b></span></h4>
<p>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation. </p>
<p>A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated. </p>
<p>A creature within the area of an  <em>antimagic field </em>or in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages. </p>
<h3 id='Challenge'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Challenge   </b></span></h3>
<p>A monster’s  </p>
<p><b>challenge rating </b> tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.  </p>
<h4 id='ExperiencePoints'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Experience Points  </b></span></h4>
<p>The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.  Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.  </p>
<h4 id='ExperiencePointsbyChallengeRating'><b>Experience Points by Challenge Rating  </b></h4>
<table><tr class=heading><th ><b>Challenge </b></th><th ><b>XP </b></th><th ><b>Challenge </b></th><th ><b>XP </b></th></tr><tr><td >0 </td><td >0 or 10 </td><td >14 </td><td >11,500 </td></tr><tr><td >1/8 </td><td >25 </td><td >15 </td><td >13,000 </td></tr><tr><td >1/4 </td><td >50 </td><td >16 </td><td >15,000 </td></tr><tr><td >1/2 </td><td >100 </td><td >17 </td><td >18,000 </td></tr><tr><td >1 </td><td >200 </td><td >18 </td><td >20,000 </td></tr><tr><td >2 </td><td >450 </td><td >19 </td><td >22,000 </td></tr><tr><td >3 </td><td >700 </td><td >20 </td><td >25,000 </td></tr><tr><td >4 </td><td >1,100 </td><td >21 </td><td >33,000 </td></tr><tr><td >5 </td><td >1,800 </td><td >22 </td><td >41,000 </td></tr><tr><td >6 </td><td >2,300 </td><td >23 </td><td >50,000 </td></tr><tr><td >7 </td><td >2,900 </td><td >24 </td><td >62,000 </td></tr><tr><td >8 </td><td >3,900 </td><td >25 </td><td >75,000 </td></tr><tr><td >9 </td><td >5,000 </td><td >26 </td><td >90,000 </td></tr><tr><td >10 </td><td >5,900 </td><td >27 </td><td >105,000 </td></tr><tr><td >11 </td><td >7,200 </td><td >28 </td><td >120,000 </td></tr><tr><td >12 </td><td >8,400 </td><td >29 </td><td >135,000 </td></tr><tr><td >13 </td><td >10,000 </td><td >30 </td><td >155,000 </td></tr></table>
<h3 id='SpecialTraits'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Special Traits </b></span></h3>
<p>Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation. </p>
<h4 id='InnateSpellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Innate Spellcasting </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating. </p>
<p>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the  </p>
<p><em>levitate </em>spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage. </p>
<p>A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them. </p>
<h4 id='Spellcasting'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Spellcasting </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as </p>
<p>explained in the  </p>
<p><em>Player’s Handbook </em>). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature. </p>
<p>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when at tuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list. </p>
<p>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level  </p>
<p><em>lightning bolt </em>spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots. </p>
<p>You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating. </p>
<h4 id='Psionics'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Psionics  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.  </p>
<h3 id='Actions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Actions   </b></span></h3>
<p>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the  <em>Player’s Handbook </em>.  </p>
<h4 id='MeleeandRangedAttacks'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Melee and Ranged Attacks  </b></span></h4>
<p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the  <em>Player’s Handbook </em>. </p>
<p><b><em>Creature vs. Target. </em></b> The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.  </p>
<p><b><em>Hit. </em></b> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “ <em>Hit </em>” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.  </p>
<p><b><em>Miss. </em></b> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “ <em>Miss: </em>” notation.  </p>
<h4 id='Multiattack'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Multiattack  </b></span></h4>
<p>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack. </p>
<h4 id='Ammunition'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Ammunition  </b></span></h4>
<p>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.  </p>
<h3 id='Reactions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Reactions </b></span></h3>
<p>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent. </p>
<h3 id='LimitedUsage'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Limited Usage </b></span></h3>
<p>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used. </p>
<p><b><em>X/Day. </em></b>The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again. </p>
<p><b><em>Recharge X-Y. </em></b>The notation “Recharge X-Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest. </p>
<p>For example, “Recharge 5-6” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6. </p>
<p><b><em>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. </em></b>This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again. </p>
<h4 id='GrappleRulesforMonsters'><b>Grapple Rules for Monsters </b></h4>
<p>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise. </p>
<p>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no </p>
<p>escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier. </p>
<h3 id='Equipment'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Equipment </b></span></h3>
<p>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately. </p>
<p> You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.  If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.  </p>
<h2 id='LegendaryCreatures'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Legendary Creatures  </b></span></h2>
<p>A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.  If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.  </p>
<h3 id='LegendaryActions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Legendary Actions   </b></span></h3>
<p>A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.  </p>
<h3 id='ALegendaryCreaturesLair'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>A Legendary Creature’s Lair   </b></span></h3>
<p>A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.  </p>
<h4 id='LairActions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Lair Actions  </b></span></h4>
<p>If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.  </p>
<h4 id='RegionalEffects'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Regional Effects  </b></span></h4>
<p>The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies. </p>
<h2 id='MonstersA'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Monsters (A)  </b></span></h2>

A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.  </p>
<p><b><em>Probing Telepathy. </em></b>  If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature’s greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.  </p>

<p><b><em>Multiattack. </em></b>  The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.  </p>
<p><b><em>Tentacle.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  <em>Hit: </em> 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature’s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can’t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by  <em>heal  </em>or another disease--curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.  </p>
<p><b><em>Tail.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target.  </p>
<p><em>Hit: </em>15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. </p>
<p><b><em>Enslave (3/Day). </em></b>  The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth’s control and can’t take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. </p>
<p>Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. </p>
<p>No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth. </p>
<h4 id='LegendaryActions'><b>Legendary Actions </b>  </h4>
<p>The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. </p>
<p><b>Detect.  </b>The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. </p>

<p><b>Tail Swipe. </b>The aboleth makes one tail attack. </p>

<h4 id='Actions'><b>Actions </b>  </h4>
<p><b><em>Multiattack. </em></b>The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. </p>
<p><b><em>Bite. </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.  </p>
<p><em>Hit: </em>10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large </p>
<p>or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target’s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. </p>
<p><b><em>Tail.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>+6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.  </p>
<p><em>Hit: </em>7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. </p>
<p><b><em>Moan. </em></b>Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours </p>
<p><b><em>Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). </em></b>The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear. </p>
<p>Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it relies on senses other than sight. </p>
<p>A duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears. </p>

<p><b><em>Multiattack. </em></b> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  </p>
<p><b><em>Bite.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em> +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.  <em>Hit: </em> 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Claw.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  <em>Hit: </em> 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Tail.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.  <em>Hit: </em> 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Frightful Presence.  </em></b>Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  </p>
<p><b><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6). </em></b> The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:  </p>
<p><b>Fire Breath. </b> The dragon exhales fire in an 90--foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  </p>
<p><b>Sleep Breath. </b> The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 90--foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.  </p>
<p><b><em>Change Shape. </em></b> The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon’s choice).  In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.  </p>
<h4 id='LegendaryActions'><b>Legendary Actions </b>  </h4>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. </p>
<p><b>Detect. </b>The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. </p>
<p><b>Tail Attack.  </b>The dragon makes a tail attack. </p>
<p><b>Wing Attack </b>  </p>
<p><b>(Costs 2 Actions). </b>The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. </p>

<p><b><em>Multiattack. </em></b> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  </p>
<p><b><em>Bite.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em> +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.  <em>Hit:  </em>19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Claw.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  <em>Hit: </em> 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Tail.  </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.  <em>Hit: </em> 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.  </p>
<p><b><em>Frightful Presence.  </em></b>Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.  </p>
<p><b><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6). </em></b> The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.  </p>
<p><b>Acid Breath. </b> The dragon exhales acid in an 90--foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  </p>
<p><b>Slowing Breath. </b> The dragon exhales gas in a 90--foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.  </p>
<p><b><em>Change Shape. </em></b> The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon’s choice).  </p>
<p>In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form. </p>
<h4 id='LegendaryActions'><b>Legendary Actions </b>  </h4>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. </p>
<p><b>Detect. </b>The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. </p>
<p><b>Tail Attack.  </b>The dragon makes a tail attack. </p>
<p><b>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).  </b>The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. </p>

The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

<p><b><em>Bound. </em></b>The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet’s wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet’s wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is transferred to the guardian. </p>
<p><b><em>Regeneration. </em></b>The shield guardian regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. </p>
<p><b><em>Spell Storing </em></b>. A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian’s amulet can cause the guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost. </p>

<p><b><em>Multiattack. </em></b>The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite. </p>
<p><b><em>Bite. </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>+19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  </p>
<p><em>Hit: </em>36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can’t bite another target. </p>
<p><b><em>Claw. </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>+19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.  </p>
<p><em>Hit:  </em>28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage. </p>
<p><b><em>Horns. </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>+19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  </p>

<p><b><em>Tail. </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>+19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.  </p>
<p><em>Hit: </em>24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. </p>
<p><b><em>Frightful Presence.  </em></b>Each creature of the tarrasque’s choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. </p>
<p><b><em>Swallow. </em></b>The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite’s damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque’s turns. </p>
<p>If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone. </p>

<p><b><em>Shapechanger. </em></b>If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. </p>
<p>While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it </p>
<p>is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. </p>
<p>While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution  </p>
<p> saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.  </p>
<p><b><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day). </em></b> If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  </p>
<p><b><em>Misty Escape. </em></b> When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is destroyed.  While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.  </p>
<p><b><em>Regeneration. </em></b> The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.  </p>
<p><b><em>Spider Climb. </em></b> The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.  </p>
<p><b><em>Vampire Weaknesses. </em></b> The vampire has the following flaws:  <em>Forbiddance.  </em>The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.  <em>Harmed by Running Water. </em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.  <em>Stake to the Heart.  </em>If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.  <em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity. </em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.  </p>
<h4 id='Actions'><b>Actio ns  </b></h4>
<p><b><em>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).  </em></b>The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.  </p>
<p><b><em>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only). </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.  <em>Hit: </em> 8 (1d8 + 4)bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage,the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18). </p>
<p><b><em>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only). </em></b><em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em></p>
<p>  +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained.  </p>
<p><em>Hit: </em>7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The </p>
<p>target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control. </p>
<p><b><em>Charm. </em></b>The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite attack. </p>
<p>Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. </p>
<p><b><em>Children of the Night (1/Day). </em></b>The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action. </p>

<h1 id='AppendixPHAConditions'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Appendix PH -A: Conditions  </b></span></h1>
<p>Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster`s attack, or other effect. Mostconditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.  A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.  If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.  The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.  </p>
<h4 id='Blinded'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Blinded  </b></span></h4>
<p>•A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. </p>
<p>•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage. </p>
<h4 id='Charmed'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Charmed  </b></span></h4>
<p>•A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. </p>

<p>•A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. </p>
<h4 id='Exhaustion'><b>Exhaustion   </b></h4>
<p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long--term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.  </p>
<p><b>Level Effect  </b></p>
<p>1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 </p>
<p>DeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. </p>
<p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. </p>
<p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. </p>
<p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. </p>
<h4 id='Frightened'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Frightened </b></span></h4>

<h1 id='AppendixPHBFantasyHistoricalPantheons'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Appendix PH -B: Fantasy -Historical Pantheons   </b></span></h1>
<p>The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.  </p>
<h4 id='TheCelticPantheon'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Celtic Pantheon  </b></span></h4>
<p>It’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.  The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.   </p>
<h4 id='TheGreekPantheon'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Greek Pantheon  </b></span></h4>
<p>The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.  </p>
<h4 id='TheEgyptianPantheon'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Egyptian Pantheon </b></span></h4>
<p>These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe. </p>
<p>The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.  </p>
<h4 id='TheNorsePantheon'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Norse Pantheon </b></span></h4>
<p>Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse. </p>
<p>The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym). </p>

<h1 id='AppendixPHCThePlanesofExistence'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Appendix PH -C: The Planes of Existence  </b></span></h1>
<p>The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality, called the  </p>
<p><b>planes of existence </b>. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.   Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.  </p>
<h2 id='TheMaterialPlane'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>The Material Plane  </b></span></h2>
<p>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.  The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.  </p>
<h2 id='BeyondtheMaterial'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Beyond the Material  </b></span></h2>
<p>Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.  </p>
<h3 id='PlanarTravel'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Planar Travel </b></span></h3>
<p>When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come. </p>
<p>Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal. </p>
<p><b><em>Spells.  </em></b>A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence.  </p>
<p><em>Plane shift </em>and  </p>
<p><em>gate </em>can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.  </p>
<p><em>Etherealness </em>allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the  </p>
<p><em>astral projection </em>spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b><em>Portals. </em></b>A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water). </p>
<h3 id='TransitivePlanes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Transitive Planes </b></span></h3>
<p>The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as </p>
<p><em>etherealness </em>and  </p>
<p><em>astral projection </em>allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond. </p>
<p>The </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>Ethereal Plane </b>is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the  </p>
<p><em>see invisibility </em></p>
<p>and  <em>true seeing </em> spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as  <em>force cage </em> and  <em>wall of force. </em> The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.  The </p>
<p><b> Astral Plane </b> is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.   </p>
<h3 id='InnerPlanes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Inner Planes   </b></span></h3>
<p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four  </p>
<p><b>Elemental Planes </b>-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning  </p>
<p><b>Elemental Chaos </b>.  At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.   </p>
<h3 id='OuterPlanes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Outer Planes   </b></span></h3>
<p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.   When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience. </p>
<p>Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs. </p>
<p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer. </p>
<p>The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them. </p>
<h4 id='OuterPlanes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Outer Planes </b></span></h4>
<p>The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the  </p>
<p><b>Upper Planes </b>. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the  </p>
<p><b>Lower Planes </b>. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable. </p>
<h4 id='Demiplanes'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Demiplanes </b></span></h4>
<p>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as  </p>
<p><em>demiplane, </em>or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that  </p>
<p>has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a  <em>plane shift </em> spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The  <em>gate </em> spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.  </p>

<p>This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.  </p>
<h3 id='CustomizingNPCs'><span style='color: DarkRed;'><b>Customizing NPCs   </b></span></h3>
<p>There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.  </p>
<p><b><em>Racial Traits.  </em></b>You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the  <em>Player’s Handbook </em>.  </p>
<p><b><em>Spell Swaps. </em></b> One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.  </p>
<p><b><em>Armor and Weapon Swaps. </em></b> You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.  </p>
<p><b><em>Magic Items.  </em></b>The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.  </p>

<p><b>Archmages </b> are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.  An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage’s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.  </p>
