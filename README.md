# CC-SRD

This repository contains the SRD 5.1 (Creative Commons) converted to other file types and data formats, intended to support the creation of tools and resources for the TTRPG community.

These files are conversions of the [Systems Reference Document (SRD) v5.1](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document) (available here: https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document) and are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Conversion from PDF is tricky, and the files may contain some formatting errors. If you find any, please open an issue or pull request.

The team at [Tabyltop](https://tabyltop.com) plans to release additional machine-readable extractions from the SRD in the near future including JSON lists of monsters, spells, and items.
